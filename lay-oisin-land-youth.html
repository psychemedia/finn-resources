<h1>The Lay of Oisín in the Land of Youth<a class="headerlink" href="#the-lay-of-oisin-in-the-land-of-youth" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>It seems likely that the tale as told by the late 19th century and early twentieth century folklorists derives from renditions of Michael Coumin’s 18th century poem <em>The lay of Oisín in the land of youth</em>, though the legend is undoubtedly older.</p>
<p>Several out-of-copyright translations of the poem can be readily found via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">archive.org</span></code>.</p>
<p>This first example is by Thomas Flannery, published in 1896. Flannery provides some historical context for the origins of the poem in his introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Irish poem given in the following pages is the composition of <em>Micheál Coimín</em> — anglicè ‘Comyn’ or ‘Cummin’ — a native of the County of Clare, who was born about the year 1688, at Kilcorcoran, near Miltown-Malbay, and died in 1760. The date of the poem may be given approximately as 1750.</p>
<p>It is called the <em>Laoi Oisín</em> partly because Oisín is the hero of the story, partly because he is represented also as the narrator — after the manner of many mediaeval and later poets who loved to grace their own compositions with the name of the ancient bard. But it does not pretend to be an ancient poem — it is just the language of one of the better educated Irish poets of Munster of the middle of the last century — however ancient the legend itself and the traditions it embodies. It is also known as <em>Laoi ah Choimímg</em> or ‘Comyn’s Lay’. For more than a hundred years it existed only in manuscript, copies of the story passed from hand to hand, and in this way and by oral transmission it gradually spread to the neighbouring counties of Kerry, Galway, Mayo — the western counties generally of Ireland, and even to the west of Scotland.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In introducing the poem, Flannery provides a summary of the story it relates, a tale we are now familiar with:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The story in outline is this. Whilst Finn and his Fenians are one day hunting around Loch Lein — otherwise the Lakes of Killarney — a lady of dazzling beauty suddenly appears, mounted on a white steed, coming apparently up from the sea. She meets Finn and tells him she has come from the Land of Youth, has heard of the fame and doughty deeds of his son Oisín, she loves him, and wants him to go with her to <em>Tír na nÓg</em>. She describes the charms and joys of that lovely land, and Oisín gladly consents to go away with her. They go away and at length reach Tir na nÓg where they are wedded. After many years of blissful life, Oisín longs to see Erin once more — longs to see his father Finn and gallant friends of former days. With much weeping and pleading Oisín’s wife at length consents to let him go, pledging him not to dismount from his horse, or he will never be able to return. Oisín accepts the pledge, returns to Erin, is amazed to find he has been away for three hundred years, is grieved beyond measure to learn that Finn and the Fenians are no more, and resolves to go back at once ; but in his generous attempt to help some workmen out of a difficulty, wishing at the same time perhaps to show his great strength, by a most melancholy accident he is thrown off his horse, he suddenly becomes a blind, old man — a mortal once more, fated never to return to the Land of Youth.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Flannery also reviews an additional scene included in the poem that is essentially extraneous to the main narrative:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is the story. An episode is thrown in of a giant and a captive príncess, who is gallantly rescued by Oisín. Whilst the episode is somewhat tedious, it is of a character frequent enough in the mediaeval tales of Europe, and it has two or three points in it of special interest.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Flannery’s translation of the poem is presented in two ways: in a metrical style that attempted to recapture something of the rhyming nature of the original language version, and in a more literal form.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The present edition contains the whole poem lopped of some excrescences and lightened of some interpolations ; it gives a literal translation for the sake of students and a new metrical version in the style and manner of the original — which the editor believes has not been attempted before. The divisions have been made and headings adopted to make the scope of the poem more clear, and they will it m hoped also make the poem easier to learn and to remember. For any who may think the word for word prose version not literal enough, there is a prettv full vocabulary of the text of the poem at the end of the book, all nicely arranged in alphabetical order, from which they can make a translation as literal — and as bald — as they like.</p>

Laoi Oisín as ṫir na n-óg — The lay of Oisín in the land of youth
by Coimín, Micheál, 1676-1760; Flannery, Thomas, 1846-1916
1896 includes a narrative translation</p>
<p>THE LAY OF OISIN IN THE LAND OF YOUTH<br />
As he told it to St. Patrick.</p>
<p>PROLOGUE.</p>
<p>I.<br />
Patrick : O noble Oisín, son of the king,<br />
Whose deeds men sing this day in song !<br />
Thy grief abate and to us relate<br />
By what strange fate thou hast lived so long !</p>
<p>II.<br />
Oisín : O Patrick, here’s the tale for thee,<br />
Tho’ sad to me its memories old —<br />
‘Twas after Gavra — I mind me well,<br />
The field where fell my Oscar bold !</p>
<p>THE LAY:</p>
<p>I. GOLDEN-HAIRED NIAMH.</p>
<p>III.<br />
One day the generous Finn my sire<br />
With olden fire led forth the chase —<br />
But our band was small when gather’d all,<br />
For past recall were the hosts of our race.</p>
<p>IV.<br />
‘Twas a summer’s morn and a mist hung o’er<br />
The winding shore of sweet Loch Lein,<br />
Where fragrant trees perfume the breeze<br />
And birds e’er please with a joyous strain.</p>
<p>V.<br />
We soon awoke the woodland deer<br />
That forced by fear fled far away —<br />
Keenly our hounds with strenuous bounds<br />
O’er moors and mounds pursued their prey.</p>
<p>VI.<br />
When lo ! into sight came a figure bright,<br />
In a blaze of light from the west it rushed—<br />
A lady fair of radiance rare<br />
Whom a white steed bare to our band, now hush’d !</p>
<p>VII.<br />
Amazed we halt, though hot the chase,<br />
To gaze on the face of the fair young queen—<br />
A marvel to Finn and his Fenian band<br />
Who ne’er in the land such beauty had seen !</p>
<p>VIII.<br />
A golden crown on her brow she bore,<br />
A mantle she wore of silken sheen<br />
All studded with stars of bright red gold —<br />
Ample each fold fell on herbage green.</p>
<p>IX.<br />
Her golden hair all fair to view<br />
In golden curls on her shoulders fell —<br />
Bright and pure were her eyes of blue<br />
As drops of the dew in a blue hare-bell,</p>
<p>X.<br />
Ruddier far her cheek than the rose<br />
Her bosom more white than the swan’s so free,<br />
Sweeter the breath of her balmy mouth<br />
Than spice of the south from over the sea.</p>
<p>XI.<br />
Her milk-white steed was of worth untold<br />
Nor bridle of gold did the charger lack —<br />
A saddle all covered with purple and gold<br />
Lay bright to behold on the steed’s proud back</p>
<p>XII.<br />
Four shoes of gold his hoofs did guard,<br />
Of gold unmarred by mixture base,<br />
A silver wreath on his crest was shown —<br />
Such steed was unknown on the earth’s fair face.</p>
<p>XIII.<br />
To Finn’s great presence drew the maid<br />
This bright array’d and softly spake —<br />
” King of the Fenian host, ” she cried<br />
” Far have I hied for sweet love’s sake ! “</p>
<p>XIV.<br />
” Who art thou, pray, O princess rare,<br />
Of form most fair, of face divine ?<br />
Gently thy errand to us make known —<br />
What land’s thine own, what name is thine ? “</p>
<p>XV.<br />
” Niamh the Golden-haired I’m named,<br />
— O Finn far-famed for wisdom and truth ! —<br />
My praise harps ring, and bards e’er sing,<br />
And my sire’s the King of the Land of Youth ! “</p>
<p>XVI.<br />
” Then tell us most lovely lady now,<br />
Why comest thou o’er seas so far ?<br />
Has heartless husband left thee to weep<br />
With grief most deep, thy mind to mar !”</p>
<p>XVII.<br />
” No husband has left me, O lordly Finn,<br />
— My heart within ne’er man did gain,<br />
Till hero of Erin, thy famous son,<br />
Its young love won, for aye to reign ! “</p>
<p>XVIII.<br />
” On which of my gallant sons, O maid,<br />
Is thy heart’s love laid, so frankly free ?<br />
Now hide not from us, O princess dear,<br />
The causes clear of thy visit to me ! “</p>
<p>XIX.<br />
” His name, O Finn, then I’ll declare —<br />
‘Tis thy famed son, so fair, so brave,<br />
Oisín the warrior, Erin’s bard,<br />
My fair reward for crossing the wave ! “</p>
<p>XX.<br />
” Then why hast thou hastened to give thy love<br />
O maiden above all maids most fair —<br />
To Oisín my own beyond all known<br />
Of princes high both rich and rare ? “</p>
<p>XI.<br />
” Good cause I ween for my course ‘he &amp;ecn,<br />
O king of tbe Fiann when I tell thee truth,<br />
Oisín’s high deeds and noble name<br />
Have won him fame in the Land of Youth.</p>
<p>XXII.<br />
” Full many a prince of high degree<br />
Hath offered me both heart and hand<br />
But whoso appealed I ne’er did yield<br />
But my heart kept sealed for my hero grand ! “</p>
<p>XXIII.<br />
Oisín: O Patrick stern, how my soul did yearn<br />
And with ardour burn for the peerless maid —<br />
No shame to tell — each word was a spell,<br />
That bound me well past mortal aid.</p>
<p>XXIV.<br />
I took her gentle hand in mine<br />
And with every sign of love I said,<br />
” Welcome a hundred thousand times,<br />
From fairy climes, O royal maid ! “</p>
<p>XXY.<br />
” Of women the rarest, fairest seen,<br />
Thou art O queen, without compeer !<br />
My soul, my life, my chosen wife,<br />
Star of my way of ray most clear ! “</p>
<p>II. THE DELIGHTS OF THE LAND OF YOUTH.</p>
<p>XXVI.<br />
” Request refused by no true knight<br />
Who knoweth aright the knightly vogue,<br />
I make of thee now — ‘tis hence to speed<br />
With me on my steed to <em>Tír na n-Óg</em>.</p>
<p>XXVII.<br />
Delightful land beyond all dreams !<br />
Beyond what seems to thee most fair —<br />
Rich fruits abound the bright year round<br />
And flowers are found of hues most rare.</p>
<p>XXVIII.<br />
Unfailing there the honey and wine<br />
And draughts divine of mead there be,<br />
No ache nor ailing night or day —<br />
Death or decay thou ne’er shalt see !</p>
<p>XXIX.<br />
” The mirthful feast and joyous play<br />
And musíc’s sway all blest, benign—<br />
Silver untold and store of gold<br />
Undreamt by the old shall all be thine !</p>
<p>XXX.<br />
” A hundred swords of steel refined<br />
A hundred cloaks of kind full rare,<br />
A hundred steeds of proudest breed<br />
A hundred hounds — thy meed when there !</p>
<p>XXXI.<br />
” A hundred coats of mail shall be thine<br />
A hundred kine of sleekest skin,<br />
A hundred sheep with fleece of gold<br />
And gems none hold these shores within.</p>
<p>XXXII.<br />
” A hundred maidens young and fair<br />
Of blithesome air shall tend on thee,<br />
Of form most meet, as fairies fleet<br />
And of song more sweet than the wild thrush free !</p>
<p>XXXIII,<br />
” A hundred knights in fights most bold<br />
Of skill untold in all chivalrie,<br />
Full-armed, bedight in mail of gold<br />
Shall in <em>Tír na n-Óg</em> thy comrades be.</p>
<p>XXXIV.<br />
” A corslet charmed for thee shall be made<br />
And a matchless blade of magic power,<br />
Worth a hundred blades in a hero’s hands,<br />
Most blest of brands in battle’s hour !</p>
<p>XXXV.<br />
“The royal crown of the King of Youth<br />
Shall shine in sooth on thy brow most fair,<br />
All brilliant with gems of lustre bright<br />
Whose worth aright none might declare.</p>
<p>XXXVI.<br />
” All things I’ve named thou shalt enjoy<br />
And none shall cloy — to endless life —<br />
Beauty and strength and power thou’lt see<br />
And I’ll e’er be thy own true wife ! “</p>
<p>XXXVII.<br />
” Refusal of mine thou ne’er shalt hear<br />
O maid without peer, of the locks of gold !<br />
My chosen wife for life I know<br />
And gladly I’ll go to <em>Tír na n-Óg</em>!”</p>
<p>III. THE DEPARTURE TO Tír NA N-ÓG.</p>
<p>XXXVIII.<br />
Forthwith the steed I then bestrode<br />
Before me rode my royal queen<br />
Who said ” O Oisín with caution ride<br />
Till side of dividing sea we’ve seen ! “</p>
<p>XXXIX.<br />
Then up rose that steed with a mighty bound<br />
Gave forth three sounding startling neighs,<br />
His mane he shook, then with fiery look<br />
His riders he took to the sea’s known ways.</p>
<p>XL.<br />
Now when from Finn and the Fenian host<br />
The steed to the coast was coursing so,<br />
There burst from the chief a cry of grief<br />
A wail of grief not brief nor low.</p>
<p>XLI.<br />
” Oh Oisín ” cried Finn with faltering voice —<br />
” My son most choice must I then lose,<br />
With never a hope to see thee again ?<br />
— My heart in twain ‘twill break and bruise!”</p>
<p>XLII.<br />
His noble features now clouded o’er<br />
And tears did pour in showers free<br />
Till breast and beard in tears were drowned —<br />
” My grief ! he e’er found this maid from the Sea ! “</p>
<p>XLIII.<br />
Oh Patrick I grieve to tell thee the tale<br />
My words now fail to find their way —<br />
How the father did part from the son of his heart,<br />
My tears e’er start when I think of the day.</p>
<p>XLIV.<br />
I drew up the steed for a moment’s rest<br />
And tenderly pressed on my sire a kiss,<br />
Then bade farewell to the Fenian band<br />
Tho’ the tears did stand in my eyes, I wis,</p>
<p>XLV.<br />
Full many a day great Finn and I<br />
And our host all nigh in gay array<br />
Held glorious feast where harps ne’er ceased<br />
And highest and least had their choice alway.</p>
<p>XLVI.<br />
Full oft our race held a royal chase<br />
While at boldest pace ran our sweet-voiced hounds —<br />
Anon in battle our javelins rattle<br />
And men like cattle fall in heaps and mounds !</p>
<p>XLVII.<br />
Patrick : O vain old Oisín, dwell no more<br />
On thy deeds of yore in the Fenian ranks,<br />
How didst thou go to <em>Tír na n-Óg</em> ?<br />
Come let me know and I’ll owe much thanks.</p>
<p>XLVIII.<br />
Oisín : We turned away as I truly said<br />
And our horse’s head we gave to the west,<br />
When lo ! the deep sea opened before<br />
While behind us bore the billows that pressed.</p>
<p>XLIX.<br />
Anon we saw in our path strange sights,<br />
Cities on heights and castles fair,<br />
Palaces brilliant with lights and flowers —<br />
The brightest of bowers were gleaming there.</p>
<p>L.<br />
And then we saw a yellow young fawn<br />
Leap over a lawn of softest green,<br />
Chased by a graceful, snow-white hound<br />
That with airy bound pressed on most keen.</p>
<p>LI.<br />
We next beheld— I tell thee true,<br />
A maid in view on a bright bay steed,<br />
An apple of gold in her hand did she hold,<br />
O’er the waves most bold she hied with speed.</p>
<p>LII.<br />
And soon we saw another sight<br />
A youthful knight who a white steed rode,<br />
The rider in purple and crimson array’d<br />
Whilst a glittering blade in his hand he showed.</p>
<p>LIII.<br />
” Yon youthful pair bothlcnight and maid —<br />
” Pray tell ” I said ” who they may be—<br />
The lady mild as a summer’s morn<br />
And knight high-born that fares so free.”</p>
<p>LIV.<br />
” In all thy sight may light on here<br />
O Oisín dear, I say with truth,<br />
There’s nought of beauty, nought of strength,<br />
Till we reach at length the Land of Youth!”</p>
<p>IV. — FOVOR OF THE BLOWS.</p>
<p>LV.<br />
And now as we rode we came in sight<br />
Of a palace bright, high-placed, and strong,<br />
Shapely its hall and lofty its wall<br />
Far beyond all e’er famed in song.</p>
<p>LVI.<br />
” What royal <em>Dún</em> is yon, O queen,<br />
That stands serene on yon hill-side,<br />
Whose towers and columns so stately spring —<br />
What prince or king doth there abide ? “</p>
<p>LVII.<br />
” In yonder <em>Dún</em> a sad queen dwells<br />
Whom force compels her life to mourn —<br />
Whom Fovor fierce of the Mighty Blows<br />
Doth there enclose from friends’ arms torn.</p>
<p>LVIII.<br />
” But captive though to that pirate proud<br />
She yet hath vowed by geasa grave,<br />
Never for life to be his wife<br />
Till won in strife ‘gainst champion brave ! “</p>
<p>LIX.<br />
“Blessing and bliss be thine ” I cried<br />
” O maid bright eyed, for thy welcome word,<br />
Tho’ grieved that woman such fate should meet<br />
Music more sweet I ne’er have heard !</p>
<p>LX.<br />
” For now we’ll go to that high-placed <em>Dún</em><br />
And help full soon that maid distressed,<br />
A champion’s steel shall Fovor feel<br />
And ‘neath my heel shall his neck be pressed ! “</p>
<p>LXI.<br />
To Fovor’s stronghold then we rode-—<br />
Unblest abode for a captive sweet !<br />
Atonce the queen with joyous mien,<br />
Came forth on the green with welcome meet.</p>
<p>LXII.<br />
In robe of rich-hued silk arrayed<br />
Was this queenly maid with the brow of snow,<br />
Her neck all fair could with swan’s compare<br />
Her cheeks did wear the rose’s glow.</p>
<p>LXIII.<br />
Of golden hue was her hair, ‘tis true,<br />
Of heavenly blue her bright eyes clear,<br />
Her lips were red as berries on bough,<br />
Shapely each brow with rare compeer !</p>
<p>LXIV.<br />
To seat ourselves we then were told —<br />
In a chair of gold each one sat down,<br />
Most royal fare was set forth there<br />
In royal ware of great renown.</p>
<p>LXV.<br />
Now when of food we had had our fill<br />
And of wine as will might fancy e’en,<br />
Thus spoke the queen, her face now pale,<br />
Now list my tale, with ears all keen !</p>
<p>LXVI.<br />
From first to last she told her tale<br />
Her cheek all pale and wet with tears —<br />
How kith and kin ne’er more she’d see<br />
Whilst Fovor free provoked her fears.</p>
<p>LXVII.<br />
” Then weep no more, O fair young queen,<br />
Henceforth I ween, thou needst not mourn,<br />
Fovor shall pay with his life this day<br />
In mortal fray for the wrongs thou’st borne!”</p>
<p>LXVIII.<br />
” Alas ! no champion can be found<br />
On earth’s great round, I fear me much,<br />
Could hand to hand such foe withstand<br />
Or free me from this tyrant’s clutch. “</p>
<p>LXIX.<br />
” I tell thee truly lady fair<br />
I’ll boldly dare him to the field<br />
Resolved to save thee or in strife<br />
Never while life doth last to yield !”</p>
<p>LXX.<br />
Ere cease my words, in savage trim<br />
The giant grim against us hies —<br />
In skins of beasts uncouthly clad,<br />
Whilst a club he had of monstrous size.</p>
<p>LXXI.<br />
No salutation from him came<br />
But his eyes aflame glared all around,<br />
Forthwith he challenged me to fight<br />
And I with delight took up my ground.</p>
<p>LXXII.<br />
For full three nights and eke three days<br />
Our deadly fray’s end seemed in doubt<br />
Till at length his head with my sword I sped<br />
O’er the plain now red with the blood pour’d out!</p>
<p>LXXIII<br />
Now when the two young maids beheld<br />
Fierce Fovor felled by my good sword,<br />
They gave three shouts of joy and glee<br />
Of joy for freedom now restored.</p>
<p>LXXIV.<br />
We then returned to the giant’s <em>dún</em><br />
Where faint in swoon at last I fell,<br />
Faint from wounds and loss of blood<br />
That still in flood gushed like a well.</p>
<p>LXXV.<br />
But now the maid from Fovor freed<br />
Ran up with speed to help me fain —<br />
My wounds she washed, and bathed with balm,<br />
And health and calm I found again,</p>
<p>LXXVI.<br />
The giant grim we buried him<br />
Deep down in earth in widest grave —<br />
We raised a stone his grave to note<br />
And his name we wrote in Ogham-craev.</p>
<p>LXXVII.<br />
A merry feast we then did hold<br />
And stories told of olden days —<br />
And when night fell we rested well<br />
On couches such as poets praise.</p>
<p>LXXVIII.<br />
When morning fair the sun did greet<br />
From slumbers sweet we fresh awoke —<br />
” Dear friends from hence I now depart—<br />
‘Twas thus the parting princess spoke.</p>
<p>LXXIX,<br />
We soon equipped us for our way<br />
For longer stay was needed not,<br />
Sad, sorrowful the leave we took,<br />
And sad the princess’ look, I wot.</p>
<p>LXXX.<br />
The further fate of that sweet maid<br />
O Patrick staid, I could not tell,<br />
No word of her I’ve heard one say<br />
E’er since the day we said farewell</p>
<p>V. — IN THE LAND OF YOUTH.</p>
<p>LXXXI<br />
We turned once more upon our course<br />
And wildly sped our horse along —<br />
No wind that sweeps the mountain drift<br />
Was half so swift or half so strong.</p>
<p>LXXXII.<br />
But now the sky began to lower,<br />
The wind in power increased full fast —<br />
Red lightning lights the mad sea-waves<br />
And madly raves the thunder past !</p>
<p>LXXXIII.<br />
A while we cowered ‘neath the storm,<br />
— All nature’s form in darkness dread —<br />
When lo ! the winds’ fierce course was run,<br />
And bright the sun appear’d o’erhead !</p>
<p>LXXXIV.<br />
And now there spread before our sight<br />
A land most bright, most rich, and fair,<br />
With hill and plain and shady bower<br />
And a royal tower of splendour rare.</p>
<p>LXXXV.<br />
And ín this royal mansion fair<br />
All colours were that eye hath seen—<br />
The blue most bright, the purest white<br />
With purple and yellow and softest green.</p>
<p>LXXXVI.<br />
To left and right of this palace bright<br />
Rose many a hall and sun-lit tower,<br />
All built of brilliant gems and stones<br />
By hands one owns of wondrous power.</p>
<p>LXXXVII.<br />
” What lovely land is that we see ?<br />
Pray answer me with maiden’s truth—<br />
Is’t penned in page that man may read,<br />
Or is it indeed the Land of Youth ?</p>
<p>LXXXVIII.<br />
” It is indeed the Land of Youth —<br />
And maiden’s truth I’ve ever told —<br />
No joy or bliss I’ve promised thee<br />
But thou shalt see this land doth hold ! “</p>
<p>XXXIX.<br />
And now there rode frorn the king’s abode<br />
To meet us on the lawn of green<br />
Thrice fifty champions of might<br />
In armour bright, of noble mien.</p>
<p>XC.<br />
And then there came in hues arrayed<br />
A hundred maids in maiden vogue —<br />
In silken garments bright and brave<br />
Who welcome gave to <em>Tír na n-Óg</em> .</p>
<p>XCI.<br />
And next marcbed forth a chosen band<br />
Of the troops of that land, a lovely sight —<br />
A king at their head of kingly tread<br />
Of mighty name and fame in fight.</p>
<p>XCII.<br />
A yellow shirt of silken weft,<br />
A cloak most deftly broidered o’er<br />
On the king in folds hung freely down<br />
Whilst a glittering crown on his head he wore.</p>
<p>XCIIÍ.<br />
And close behind him there was seen<br />
His youthful queen — a consort meet –<br />
With fifty maidens in her train<br />
Who sang a strain divinely sweet,</p>
<p>XCIV.<br />
Then spoke the king in kindly voice,<br />
” O friends rejoice, for here you see<br />
Oisín the famous son of Finn,<br />
Who spouse of winsome Niamh shall be ! “</p>
<p>XCV.<br />
He takes me warnly by the hand<br />
Then as we stand he speaks anew —<br />
” Welcome ” he cries ” I give thee now,<br />
A hundred thousand welcomes true !</p>
<p>XCVI.<br />
This kingdom which o’er seas and lands<br />
Thou’st sought, now stands reveal’d to thee<br />
Long shalt thou live our race among<br />
And ever young as thou shalt see.</p>
<p>XCVII.<br />
No pleasure e’er that entered mind<br />
But here thou’lt find without alloy,<br />
This is the land thy bards e’er sing<br />
And I am the King of this Land of Joy.</p>
<p>XCVIII.<br />
” Here is our gentle, fair young queen,<br />
Mother of Niamh the Golden-baired<br />
Who crossed for thee the stormy sea<br />
And thine to be all dangers dared ! “</p>
<p>XCIX.<br />
I thanked the king with grateful heart<br />
To the queen apart I bowed me low —<br />
We tarried no longer without the walls<br />
But entered the halls of <em>Ri na n-Óg</em> .</p>
<p>C.<br />
There came the nobles of all that land<br />
The great and grand to sing our praise—<br />
And feast was held with all delights<br />
For ten long nights and ten long days.</p>
<p>CI.<br />
I then was wedded to Gold-haired Niamh —<br />
And there to leave the tale were well —<br />
Thus did I go to Tír-na-n-Og<br />
Though grief and woe ‘tis now to tell.</p>
<p>CII.<br />
Patrick : Come finish the charming tale thou’st told,<br />
O Oisín of gold, of the weapons of war—<br />
Why from such land didst thou e’er return ?<br />
I fain would learn what the causes are.</p>
<p>CIII.<br />
And say whilst there thou didst abide<br />
If thee thy bride any children bore,<br />
Or wast thou for long in the Land of Youth ? —<br />
I long in truth to list such lore !</p>
<p>CIV.<br />
Oisín : I had by Niamh of the Golden Hair<br />
Three children fair as ever smiled<br />
Whose sweetness gave us daily joys—<br />
Two gallant boys and a maiden mild.</p>
<p>CV.<br />
Patrick : O sweet-voiced Oisín, do not grieve, —<br />
Where didst thou leave those children sweet?<br />
Tell me the names of thy offspring fair,<br />
And tell me where they mirthful meet.</p>
<p>CVI.<br />
Oisín : Those children three rich heirs would be<br />
To kingdoms free and fair and great,<br />
To roval sceptre, crown of gold<br />
And wealth untold, no tongue could state.</p>
<p>CVII.<br />
My gentle Niamh on her boys bestowed<br />
The names I owed most honour to —<br />
Finn the bright of the hosts of might,<br />
And Oscar who’d fight for the right and true</p>
<p>CVIII.<br />
And I my daughter fair did call<br />
By a name which all fair names o’ershades —<br />
In beauty’s virtue and sweetness , power<br />
By rightful dower — the Flower-of-Maids</p>
<p>VI. The return from Tír-na-n-Óg.</p>
<p>CIX.<br />
Long lived I there as now appears<br />
Tho’ short the years seemed e’er to me,<br />
Till a strong desire of my heart took hold<br />
Finn and my friends of old to see.</p>
<p>CX.<br />
One day of the king I asked for leave<br />
And of loving Niamh who grieved the while,<br />
To visit dear Erin once again<br />
My native plain, my native isle.</p>
<p>CXI.<br />
” I will not hinder thee, ” she cried,<br />
” From crossing the tide for duty dear,<br />
Tho’ it bodes me ill and my heart doth fill<br />
With doubts that chill and deadly fear ! “</p>
<p>CXII.<br />
” Why shouldst thou fear, O queen my own,<br />
When the way shall be shown by the magic steed<br />
The steed that bore us o’er the sea —<br />
And home to thee I’ll safely speed ? “</p>
<p>CXIII.<br />
” Remember then what now I say —<br />
If thou shouldst lay a foot to ground<br />
There’s no return for thee e’ermore<br />
To this fair shore where home thou’st found !</p>
<p>CXIV.<br />
I tell thee truly vain’s thy might<br />
Shouldst thou alight from thy white steed,<br />
For never again shouldst thou in truth<br />
See Land of Youth or hither speed.</p>
<p>CXV.<br />
” A third time now I thee implore<br />
And beg thee sore thy seat to hold,<br />
Or else at once thy strength shall go,<br />
And thou shalt grow both blind and old !</p>
<p>CXVI.<br />
” ‘Tis woe to me, Oisín, to see<br />
How thou canst be so anxious-soul’d<br />
About green Erin, changed for aye —<br />
For past’s the day of the Fenians bold.</p>
<p>CXVII.<br />
In Erin green there’s now nought seen<br />
But priests full lean and troops of saints —<br />
Then Oisín, here’s my kiss to thee,<br />
Our last, may be — my heart — now faints ! “</p>
<p>CXVIII.<br />
I gazed into her soft sad eyes<br />
Whilst the tears did rise and well in my own —<br />
O saint severe, thou’dst weep a tear<br />
To hear that dear wife’s hopeless moan !</p>
<p>CXIX.<br />
By solemn vow I then was bound,<br />
To Erin’s ground ne’er to descend,<br />
And if to keep this vow I failed<br />
No power availed or could befriend.</p>
<p>CXX.<br />
I pledged to keep my solemn vow<br />
And do all now enjoined had been,<br />
I mounted then my steed of spell<br />
And said farewell to king and queen.</p>
<p>CXXI.<br />
I kissed once more my Gold-haired Niamh,<br />
— My heart doth grieve as I tell the tale —<br />
I kissed my sons and daughter young<br />
Whose hearts were wrung and cheeks were pale.</p>
<p>CXXII.<br />
I turned my steed at last to the strand<br />
And passed from the Land of Lasting Youth —<br />
Boldly my horse pursued his course<br />
And the billows’ force was nought in sooth.</p>
<p>CXXIII.<br />
O Patrick of the orders pure<br />
No lie, full sure, I’e told but truth,<br />
Thus have I tried my tale to weave<br />
And thus did I leave the Land of Youth</p>
<p>CXXIV.<br />
If of good bread I could get my fill<br />
As Finn at will gave to each guest<br />
Each day I’d pray to the King of Grace<br />
That Heaven might be thy place of rest.</p>
<p>CXXV.<br />
Patrick : Thou shalt of bread have quite thy fill<br />
And drink at will, O ancient bard !<br />
Dear to me thy pleasant tale !<br />
It ne’er can fail to win regard.</p>
<p>VII. Oisín in Erin.</p>
<p>CXXVI.<br />
Oisín : I need not tell each thing befell<br />
Me and my spell-borne steed each day,<br />
But at length green Erin’s isle we reach,<br />
And up the beach we bend our way.</p>
<p>CXXVII.<br />
When once I found my steed trod ground,<br />
I looked arouad on every side,<br />
Anxious for tidings small or great<br />
Of Finn and his state, once Erin’s pride.</p>
<p>CXXVIII.<br />
Not long in doubt had I thus stayed<br />
When a cavalcade came up the way —<br />
Strange crowd, I thought, of women and men<br />
And past my ken their strange array.</p>
<p>CXXIX.<br />
Right gentlv they saluted me<br />
But marvell’d much to see my size,<br />
They marvell’d at my wondrous steed<br />
For on such breed they’d ne’er set eyes.</p>
<p>CXXX.<br />
I asked — with fear my heart within —<br />
If the noble Finn were yet alive,<br />
Or if his hosts that kept the coasts<br />
Of Erin safe, did yet survive.</p>
<p>CXXXI.<br />
” Of Finn, ” they said, ” we oft have heard —<br />
His name and fame are now world-wide,<br />
But full three hundred years have passed<br />
Since Finn and the last of the Fenians died.</p>
<p>CXXXII.<br />
” Many a book and many a tale<br />
Have bards of the Gael that treat of Finn —<br />
Of his strength and valour and wisdom bright<br />
Of his race of might and mighty kin.</p>
<p>CXXXIII.<br />
” We’ve also heard of Finn’s great son—<br />
A youth of wondrous mien and mould,<br />
That a lady came hither from over the sea<br />
And with her went he to <em>Tír na n-Óg</em> “</p>
<p>CXXXIV.<br />
Now when those words fell on mine ear —<br />
That Finn and his heroes were no more —<br />
My heart was chilled — my soul was filled<br />
With woe unwilled ne’er felt before.</p>
<p>CXXXV.<br />
I stopped no longer upon my course<br />
But swift my horse urged onward flew —<br />
Till Alvin’s hill o’er Leinster’s plain<br />
Rose once again before my view.</p>
<p>CXXXVI.<br />
What shock I felt none could report,<br />
To see the court of Finn of the steeds<br />
A ruin lone, all overgrown<br />
With nettles and thorns and rankest weeds!</p>
<p>CXXXVIl.<br />
I found alas, ‘twas a vain pursuít,<br />
A bootless, fruitless, visit mine !<br />
Great Finn was dead and the hosts he led<br />
For this I’d sped thro’ ocean’s brine !</p>
<p>CXXXVIIX.<br />
But let me tell my story all—<br />
Tho’ Alvin’s roofless hall I’d seen,<br />
I still would see spots dear to me<br />
Where Fenians free and Finn had been.</p>
<p>CXXXIX.<br />
In passing through the Thrushes’ Glen<br />
A crowd of men in straits I see,<br />
Full thrice five score and haply more<br />
At toil full sore awaited me.</p>
<p>CXL.<br />
Then forth there spoke a man of that herd<br />
With suppliant word to me address’d —<br />
” Come to our help, O champion brave,<br />
Come quick to save us thus distress’d ! “</p>
<p>CXLI.<br />
I rode up briskly to the crowd<br />
And found them bow’d beneath a weight—<br />
A flag of marble great and long<br />
Bore down the throng who moaned their fate.</p>
<p>CXLII.<br />
Now all who tried to lift that stone<br />
Did pant and groan most piteously —<br />
Till some its crushing weight drove mad<br />
And some fell dead, most sad to see !</p>
<p>CXLIII.<br />
Then cried a steward of that crowd<br />
And said aloud, ” O haste and hie,<br />
O gallant knight to our relief<br />
Or else ‘tis brief ere all shall die ! “</p>
<p>CXLIV.<br />
“A shameful thing it is to say —<br />
For such array of men these days —<br />
They’re powerless of blood and bone<br />
Full easily that stone to raise ! “</p>
<p>CXLV.<br />
” If Oscar, Oisín’s valiant son<br />
Laid hold upon that marble stone<br />
With right hand bare he’d hurl’t in air<br />
Flinging it fair, with ne’er a groan ! “</p>
<p>CXLVI.<br />
Asked thus for help I did not lag<br />
Bur ‘neath the flag I placed one hand —<br />
Full perches seven that stone I hurl<br />
And scare each churl in all that band !</p>
<p>CXLVII.<br />
But scarce alas ! that stone had passed<br />
With that fair cast when ah ! the strain —<br />
The strain it broke the white steed’s girth,<br />
I fell to earth, doomed now to pain !</p>
<p>CXLVIII.<br />
No sooner had I touched the ground<br />
Than with abound my steed took fright —<br />
Away, away, to the west he rushed !<br />
Whilst all stood hush’d at such strange sight !</p>
<p>CXLIX.<br />
At once I lose the sight of my eyes,<br />
My youth’s bloom dies, lean age began,<br />
And I was left of strength bereft<br />
A helpless, hopeless, blind old man l</p>
<p>CL.<br />
O Patrick, now the tale thou hast,<br />
As each thing passed, indeed, in truth,<br />
My going away, my lengthened stay,<br />

Laoi Oisín as ṫir na n-óg — The lay of Oisín in the land of youth
by Coimín, Micheál, 1676-1760; Flannery, Thomas, 1846-1916
1896 includes a narrative translation</p>
<p>Literally :</p>
<p>1. O noble Oisín, O son of the king, who was best in deed of valour and battle, relate to us now without grief how thou hast lived after all the other Fenians.</p>
<p>2. I will tell thee that, O new-come Patrick, though sad to me to speak of it aloud — ‘twas after the hard-fought field of Gavra, where alas, was slain the valiant Oscar !</p>
<p>3. One day as we the Fenians were all (assembled) — the generous Finn and all that survived of us — though sad (and) sorrowful our converse after our heroes had been laid low—</p>
<p>4. At a hunt on a misty morning on the circling shores of Loch Lein, where there were trees most fragrant of bloom and musie at all times sweetly (sung) by birds —</p>
<p>5. Literally : There was roused by us the hornless doe that was best in bounding, running and (all) activity — our hounds and dogs were all close after her in full chase.</p>
<p>6. It was not long till we saw a swift rider coming towards us from the west — a youthful maiden who was most beautiful of countenance, on a graceful white steed most fleet in movement.</p>
<p>7. We all halted from the chase at the sight of the countenance of the royal lady — wonder seized Finn and the Fenians who had never (before) seen a woman so beautiful.</p>
<p>8. There was a royal crown upon her head and (she had) a dark-brown mantle of costly silk stamped with stars of red gold, covering her shoes down to the grass.</p>
<p>9. A ringlet of gold was hanging down from each yellow tress of her golden hair — her blue eyes (were) clear and cloudless as a dew-drop on a blade of grass.</p>
<p>10. Her cheek was redder than the rose, her complexion fairer than (hue of) the swan upon the wave, sweeter yet was the taste of her little mouth than honey that is taken (mixed) with red wine.</p>
<p>11. A cloth wide, long, and smooth was covering the white steed, (there was) a saddle adorned with red gold, and (she held) a gold-bitted bridle in her right hand.</p>
<p>12. Four shapely shoes were under him of yellow gold of the finest quality, a wreath of silver (he had) in the back of his head — not in the world was thero a better steed.</p>
<p>13. She came into the presence of Finn and spoke in a tone gentle and earnest, and said : ” O king of the Fianns, long and from afar has been my journey ! “</p>
<p>14. ” Who art thou thyself, O young queen, O woman best in figure, beauty, and countenance ? Relate to us now thy story from the beginning and tell us thy name and thy land ! “</p>
<p>15. “Niamh of the Head of Gold is my own name, O most valiant Finn of the great hosts — beyond (all) the women of the world I have gained fame, and I am the fair daughter of the King of Youth.”</p>
<p>16. ” Tell us, O gentle queen, the cause of thy coming over the sea from afar — is it thy husband who has gone from thee, or what is the trouble that is on thee? “</p>
<p>17. ” It is not that husband has gone from me — never yet have I been pledged to any man, O Fenian King of the highest fame — but affection and love I have given to thy son.”</p>
<p>18. ” To which of my sons O blooming maid, hast thou given love and liking? Do not hide from us now the (whole) cause, but tell us thy trouble, O woman! “</p>
<p>19. “I myself will tell thee that, O Finn — it is thy lovable, handsome son, of the hard weapons, high-minded Oisín of the strong arms — he is the hero that I now speak of.”</p>
<p>20. ” What is the cause for which thou hast given love — O beautiful maid of the glossy hair — to my own fair Oisín beyond all others, (seeing that there are) so many high princes under the sun ? “</p>
<p>21. ” Not without cause O king of the Fenians, have I come from afar for him, but I received an account of him, of his excellence of body and mind.</p>
<p>22. “It is many a king’s son and high prince have offered me love and lasting affection, I never consented to (accept) any man till I gave love to the valiant Oisín ! “</p>
<p>23. By that hand on thee O Patrick — and not shameful for me to tell it — there was not a part of me but was in love with the beautiful maid of the glossy hair.</p>
<p>24. I took her hand in mine and said moreover with sweet-toned voice ” The kindest welcome I give thee to this land O lovely youthful queen ! “</p>
<p>25. ” Thou art the brightest and fairest of bloom, ‘tis thou I should prefer for wife – thou art my choice above the women of the world, O kindly star of the brightest look ! “</p>
<p>26. “Commands that true heroes do not disregard I impose on thee now, O generous Oisín, to come with me on my horse and (thus) go away to <em>Tír na n-Óg</em>.</p>
<p>27. ” It is the most delightful land to be found in the world, the land of most renown now beneath the sun — the trees bending with fruit and blossom, and foliage growing to the tips of the branches.</p>
<p>28. ” Abundant in it are (the) honey and wine and everything (good) that eye hath seen, decay shalL not come upon thee with thou shalt not see failure or death !</p>
<p>29. ” Thou shalt get feasting, play, and drinking, thou shalt get music most sweet on harp-string, thou shalt get silver and gold, and thou shalt get also ahundance of jewels.</p>
<p>30. ” Thou shalt have a hundred swords and no deceit, and a hundred mantles of satin of costly quality, thou shalt have a hundred steeds most swift in battle, thou shalt have with them a hundred keen hounds.</p>
<p>31. “Thou shalt have a hundred suits of armour and shirts of satin, a hundred cows and also a hundred calves, thou shalt have a hundred sheep with fleeces of gold, thou shalt have a hundred gems that are not to be found in this world (of thine).</p>
<p>32. ” Thou shalt have a hundred handmaids young and mirthful, bright and glorious as the sun, of the best features, figure, and complexion, whose voices are sweeter than the song of birds.</p>
<p>33. “Thou shalt have a hundrad warriors most brave in battle, most aceomplished too in feats of activitY, armed and equipped before thee if thou comest with me to the Land of Youth.</p>
<p>34. “Thou shalt have a protecting, well-fitting corslet, and a gold-hilted sword of most cunning stroke, worth a hundred (swords) in the hand of a true hero – its like on land thou hast never seen.</p>
<p>35. ” Thou shalt get the royal diadem of the King of Youth that never yet was given to anyone under the sun, bright, brilliant with precious stones, whose worth cannot be put in words.</p>
<p>36. “Thou shalt have everything that I have said to thee, and other delight without sorrow, without weeping, thou shalt have beauty, strength, and power, and myself thou shalt have for wife ! “</p>
<p>37. ” Refusal at all I will not give, O pleasant queen of the tresses of gold, thou art my choice beyond the women of the world, and I will go with delight to the Land of the Young ! “</p>
<p>38. On the steed’s back we went away together, before me sat the maiden, who said ” O Oisín let us go softly at first till we reach the opening into the great sea.”</p>
<p>39. Then arose that steed with strength and when we reached the edge of the strand, he shook himself then for the journey and let forth three neighs aloud.</p>
<p>40. When Finn and the Fenians saw the steed swiftly (going) in his course and turning his face to the strong sea, they uttered three cries of grief.</p>
<p>41. ” O Oisín ” said Finn weak and faint, ” my grief is that thou art going away, (leaving) me without a hope to see thee come back again to me all triumphant ! “</p>
<p>42. His features and beauty [=his beautiful features] changed and he let fall showers of tears, which drowned his bright face and bosom, and he said ” My woe, O Oisín, thy going from me ! “</p>
<p>43. Oh Patrick, a melancholy event was our parting from each other then, the parting of the father from his own son — sad and weak am I through having to tell it.</p>
<p>44. I kissed my father tenderly, lovingly, and the same (mark of) affection I received from him, I bade farewell also to the Fenians, whilst the tears poured down my cheek.</p>
<p>45. Many a delightful day I and Finn and the Fenians with us in full glory were playing chess and carousing and listening to music — a gallant company !</p>
<p>46. [Or] hunting in tbe pleasant glens, our sweet-voiced hounds being with us — another time we were in the rough battle slaughtering warriors full vigorously !</p>
<p>47. O vain Oisín, quietly leave (treating) of thy valiant deeds amongst the Fenians — How didst thou go to the Land of the Young? Continue now for us thy story without a lie.</p>
<p>48. We turned our back to the land and our face directly to the west, the smooth sea ebbed hefore us, and filled in swelling waves in our rear.</p>
<p>49. We saw wonders on our way, — cities, courts and castles — bright palaces and fortresses, splendid sunny mansions and royal dwellings.</p>
<p>50. We saw also by our side a hornless doe bounding swiftly, apd a red-eared, vigorous, white hound hunting it boldly in the chase.</p>
<p>51. We saw also — ‘tis no invention — a young maid on a brown steed (with) an apple of gold in her right hand, riding over the top of the waves.</p>
<p>52. We saw a short distance behind her, a young horseman on a steed most white, (dressed) in cloth of purple and red satin, with a gold-hilted sword in his right hand.</p>
<p>53. ” Who are those two I see yonder ? O gentle queen, let me know — that woman of the beautiful countenance, and that graceful horseman on steed most white ? “</p>
<p>54. Take no notice of what thou shalt see O gentle Oisín, nor (mind) what thou hast yet seen, they are all as nothing till we reach in earnest the Land of the Young.”</p>
<p>55. We saw next, away far off— a bright, sunny palace, smooth-fronted, more fair of shape and look than all else to be found in the whole world.</p>
<p>56. ” What kingly, most bright fortress, most beautiful of all eye has seen, are we approaching now, and who is the high-prince over that fortress ? “</p>
<p>57. ” It is the daughter of the king of the Land of the Living who is queen now in yonder fortress, whom Fovor-of-the-Blows of Druim-loghach took away with him by the great strength of his arms and (by) might.</p>
<p>58. ” Bonds she imposed on that robber never to make her his wife, till she should find a knight or true hero who would give him battle hand to hand. “</p>
<p>59. “Bear sway and blessing, O gold-haired Niamh ! I have never heard any music that was better than that most sweet word from thy honeyed mouth, though great grief it is to us (to hear of) a woman of her rank being so treated.</p>
<p>60. ” Let us go now to visit her in that fortress and it may be for me it is fated to slay that mighty warrior by feats of strength as was my custom. “</p>
<p>61. We went then to the fortress and there came (out) to us the young princess whose splendour was equal to the sun’s, and she gave us a hundred welcomes.</p>
<p>62. There was a robe of yellow silk on this queen of the lovely complexion, her skin was fair as the swan upon the wave, her cheeks of the colour of the rose.</p>
<p>63. Of the colour of gold was her hair, and her blue eyes clear without a mist, her little mouth of honey was of the berries’ hue, each slender brow was clear cut in shape.</p>
<p>64. We then sat down, each of us in a chair of gold — much food was placed before us, with drinking horns filled with <em>beoir</em>.</p>
<p>65. When we had eaten enough of food and tasted many sweet wines, the gentle young queen spoke and said ” Listen to me quietly ! “</p>
<p>66. She told us her whole story fully and fairly and the tears fell on her cheek, and said she could never return to her own country whilst the mighty giant was alive.</p>
<p>67. ” List, be silent, O young queen, cease from thy grief and weep not, and I swear by my hand to thee, that by me shall fall that murderous giant. “</p>
<p>68. ” There is no hero at all to be found now— however great his repute for valour throughout the world — who would give battle hand to hand to this fierce giant — alas
me ! “</p>
<p>69. “I tell thee O fair queen, that not terrible to me is his coming against me, and if he fall not by the strength of my arms, then I will fall in thy defence. “</p>
<p>70. Not long till we saw coming the mighty giant most hateful of look, clothed in skins of deer, with a club of iron in his hand.</p>
<p>71. He saluted us not, nor bowed to us, but glared into the face of the young maid (his captive) declared battle and stern conflict (against me), and I went forth to encounter him.</p>
<p>72. For the space of three nights and three days we were (engaged) in that tough struggle, but though stout was that great giant, at last I cut his head off him.</p>
<p>73. When the two young maids saw the great giant lying powerless on the ground, they uttered three cries of delight with great exultation and rejoicing.</p>
<p>74. We then went into the castle — I was bruised, weak and faint, my blood flowing full freshly , and coming swift and hot from my wounds.</p>
<p>75. The daughter of the King of the Living came quickly to my relief, poured healing balm into my wounds and immediately I was well and strong.</p>
<p>76. We buried the big man in a grave earth-deep, wide, and clear, I raised his head-stone over his grave, and wrote his name upon it in the Ogham-of-Branches.</p>
<p>77. We took our meal joyfully, and merry were we then after it, and in the castle warmly-covered beds of the feathers of birds were prepared for us.</p>
<p>78. On its morrow at break of day we awoke from our slumber, ” It is fitting for me” said the king’s daughter ” to set out without further rest to my own land.”</p>
<p>79. We dressed without delay and took our leave of the maiden — grieved and mournful were we after her, and none the less was the sunny maid after us.</p>
<p>80. It is not known to me, O gentle Patrick, what happened that young queen (afterwards) from the day we parted from her, or even if she ever returned to the Land-of-the-Living.</p>
<p>81. We turned our back to the castle, with our steed under us in full course — swifter to our mind that white steed than a March wind over a mountain’s ridge.</p>
<p>82. It was not long till the sky darkened, and the wind rose (and blew) in every direction, the great mad sea kindled terribly, but there was no glimpse to be seen of tha sun.</p>
<p>83. A while we were anxiously gazing at the dark clouds and on the stars that sometimes showed — when suddenly the wind and storm abated and brightly shone Phoebus above our heads.</p>
<p>84. We saw then at our side a most lovely land all blooming — beautiful, smooth, clear plains, and a royal castle very splendid.</p>
<p>85. — There was not a colour (of all) eye had seen — of bright blue, of green, and of white — of purple, of red, and of yellow — but was (to be found) in that royal palace that I am speaking of.</p>
<p>86. There were on the other eide of this castle, bright, sun-warmed dwellings and mansions all made of precious stones by the hands of cunning craftsmen and noble artists.</p>
<p>87. ” What bright, lovely country is that yonder, O gentle maid of the tresses of gold — (a country) of the fairest aspect eye has ever looked upon — or is that the Land of Youth ? “</p>
<p>88. ” It is indeed, O generous Oisín ! no untruth have I told thee about it — there is nothing of all that I have promised thee, but may be seen by thee for ever ! “</p>
<p>89. It was not long till we saw coming towards us from the castle to meet us thrice fiíty warriors the strongest and handsomest, and of highest fame and character.</p>
<p>90. There came to us after that a hundred young maids of the greatest beauty, in silken garments adorned with gold, welcoming us to their own land.</p>
<p>91. We saw next coming forth a band of the very choicest troops, and an illustrious, powerful, mighty king, best in figure, features, and complexion.</p>
<p>92. A yellow shirt of the smoothest silk (was) on him, and over it a bright cloak adorned with gold — and on his head a glittering crown of gold, shining and brilliant.</p>
<p>93. We saw coming next the young queen of the highest fame, and fifty maidens sweet-voiced, modest, of the fairest form, in her train.</p>
<p>94. When they had all come into one place thus kindly spoke the King of Youth and said — ” Here is Oisín the son of Finn, the chosen spouse of Gold-haired Niamh ! “</p>
<p>95. He seized me then by the hand and said loud enough for the whole host ” O valiant Oisín O son of the king, a hundred thousand weleomes to thee !</p>
<p>96. ” This land in which thou hast arrived — its virtues I will not hide from thee, truly long and lasting shail thy life he, and thou shalt be young for ever.</p>
<p>97. ” There is no delight of all the heart has ever imagined that is not in this country for thee, — thou mayest O Oisín truly believe me, for I am King of the Land of Youth ! “</p>
<p>98. ” Here is our fair queen, and here our daughter Niamh the Golden-haired, who crossed the smooth sea for thee, to have thee for her husband for ever! “</p>
<p>99. I gave thanks to the king and bowed low to the virtuous queen ; we did not delay longer there but entered the Palace of the King of Youth.</p>
<p>100. (Then) came the nobles of that fair city both men and women to greet us — there was feasting and festivity there continuously for the space of ten nights and ten days.</p>
<p>101. I was married (then) to Gold-haired Niamh — O Patrick from Rome, of the white croziers, — thus was it I went to the Land of Youth, though sad and sorrowful for me to treat of it.</p>
<p>102. Continue thy story further, O Oisín of the golden words, O Oisín of the warlike arms, how didst thou leave the Land of Youth ? I feel it long till thou revealest the reason.</p>
<p>103. Tell me too with great kindness hadst thou any children by Niamh, or wast thou long in the Land of tlie Young ? Tell us the story now without grieving.</p>
<p>104. I had by Gold-haired Niamh children of the fairest complexion and greatest beauty — best featured, best shaped, brightest hued — two young sons and one fair daughter.</p>
<p>105. O pleasant Oisín, continue thy story and tell me where thy children are, tell me their names without delay, and the country they are (now) living in.</p>
<p>106. Niamh held for them the Land-of-Youth, the Land-of-the-Living, and the Land-of-Virtues, a rod of lordship [sceptre] and crown of kingly gold and a wealth of gems I do not mention.</p>
<p>107. Gold-haired Niamh gave to my two boys the names of my father and my well-beloved son — Finn the illustrious and victorious, and head of the hosts — and golden Oscar of the deadly weapons.</p>
<p>108. I myself gave to my fair daughter with the consent of most lovable Niamh, in virtue of her beauty and great sweetness the true name — Flower-of-women.</p>
<p>109. I spent (there) a long-lasting period — three hundred years apparently and more — till (at length) I thought within myself I should like to see (once more) Finn and the Fenians alive.</p>
<p>110. One day I asked leave of the king and of my gentle wife, Golden-haired Niamh, to go back to Erin again to see my father Finn and his great host</p>
<p>111. ” Thou shalt get leave, ” said the lovely woman, “though woeful the subject thou hast broached — for I fear thou wilt never come back again duilng thy lifetime, to my own land, my Oisín of victory ! “</p>
<p>112. “What cause for fear have we, O sunny queen, when the white steed shall be at my will ? He will easily ahow me the qay, and I shall return to thee safe ! “</p>
<p>113. ” Remember, O Oisín, what I am saying — if thou layest foot to smooth ground there is no return for thee ever again to this lovely land where I am !</p>
<p>114. ” I tell thee again without falsehood, if thou alightest from the white steed, thou shalt never come (again) to the Land of Youth — O golden Oisín of the victorious arms ! “</p>
<p>115. ” For the third time I say to thee, shouldst thou come off thy horse, that thou wilt be a blind, withered old man, without strength or spirit, unable to run or bound !</p>
<p>116. “I think it woeful, dear Oisín, that thou shouldst ever go to green Erin again, she is not now as she was (of old) and thou never shalt see Finn of the hosts !</p>
<p>117. ” Thou wilt not find now in Erin eastward (any) but fathers of orders and troops of saints — then beloved Oisín, here is my kiss to thee — to the Land of Youth, woe, woe ! I fear thou never wilt return ! “</p>
<p>118. I looked with sorrow into her face, and a shower of tears fell from my eyes — O stern Patrick, even thou wouldst have pitied her, to see her tearing the tresses of her soft, golden hair ! “</p>
<p>119. She put me under strict bonds to go and come without touching ground, and told me, that such was their power, if I should break them, I should not return safe.</p>
<p>120. I promised her everything faithfully — that I would do all she told me — I mounted the back of the white steed, and bade fareweil to the people of the castle.</p>
<p>121. I kissed my gentle wife, and melancholy were we at the parting — (I kissed also) my two sons and young daughter, who were in grief shedding tears.</p>
<p>122. I then prepared myself for the journey and turned my back to the Land of Youth — swiftly the horse rushed away with me, as he had done (before) with me and Goldhaired Niamh.</p>
<p>123. O Patrick of the orders and of the saints, a falsehood I have never yet told thee — there is now for thee the substance of my story and how I left the Land of Youth.</p>
<p>124. If I could get abundance of bread, as I used to get at all times from Finn, I would pray to the King of Graces that thou mightst be saved for ever on account of it.</p>
<p>125. Thou shalt have food and drink ail unstinted now from me — sweet to me the words of thy lips — continue thy story still for me.</p>
<p>126. Our tale is not told minutely about everything that happened to me — till I came back again to green Erin of the many gems.</p>
<p>127. On (my) coming then to land I gazed minutely in every direction — and then I began to fear really that no tidings could be found of Finn.</p>
<p>128. Not long and no great while was I (standing) till I saw coming towards me up from the west a great cavalcade of men and women, and they came up to me.</p>
<p>129. They greeted me kindly and sweetly and wonder seized each one of them, on seeing the size of my body, my figure, my look, and my countenance.</p>
<p>130. I inquired then of them if they had heard that Finn was alive, or if any one else of the Fenians still lived — or what calamity had happened to them.</p>
<p>131. ” We have heard (men) treat of Finn, for strength, activity and valour — that there never was his equal in person, in mind, in fame.</p>
<p>132. ” Many a book is there to be found amongst the sweet, melodious bards of the Gael, of which we could not easily tell thee — that speaks of the deeds of Finn and the Fenians.</p>
<p>133. ” We have heard that Finn had a son of distinguished beauty and form, that a young maid came hither for him, and that he went away with her to the Land of Youth.”</p>
<p>134. When I heard that speech — that neither Finn nor one of the Fenians (now) lived — a faintness and great grief seized me, and full gloomy was I after them.</p>
<p>135. I did not stop then in my course, but forthwith I went away swiftly, rapidly, and turned my face straight, direct to renowned Alvin of broad Leinster.</p>
<p>136. Great was my amazement then that I could not see the court of Finn of the hosts — there was nothing in its place truly, but weeds, chickweed and nettles.</p>
<p>137. Alas, O Patrick, and alas, my woe ! an empty (useless) visit was it for me, with no tidings (whatever) to be got of Finn or of the Fenians ! ‘tis that has left me in sorrow for (the rest of) my days !</p>
<p>138. I will follow up the story for thee, O Patrick — after I had left Alvin of Leinster, there was no dwelling-place in which the Fiann had ever lived that I did not visit eagerly and anxiously.</p>
<p>139. In passing through Glenasmole I saw a great gathering there — three hundred men and more were before me in that glen.</p>
<p>140. One of the herd then spoke to me, and said with loud voice ” Come to our assistance O kingly hero, and release us from this dire difficulty ! “</p>
<p>141. I then came up to the spot, and there the crowd were labouring under a great flag of marble — the weight of the flag was bearing down upon them and to cast it away from them they had no power.</p>
<p>142. Some of them who were down under the flag were being miserably crushed — with the distressing weight of the great load many of them lost their senses.</p>
<p>143. Then one of the stewards spoke and said : ” O youthful kingly champion, relieve at once our men, or a man of them at all shall not iive ! “</p>
<p>144. ” It is a shameful word now to say — seeing the number of men there are here — that they could not with the entire strength of the crowd lift that stone full stoutly !</p>
<p>145. “If Oscar son of Oisín lived he would seize that stone in his right hand, he would send it with a cast over (the heads of) this crowd — no falsehood am I accustomed to speak ! “</p>
<p>146. I leaned to my right side and seized the flag in one hand — with the strength and vigour of my arms I cast it seven perches írom that spot !</p>
<p>147. With the exertion of hurling that very great flag the golden girth of the white steed broke — full swiftly I came to the ground on the soles of my two feet !</p>
<p>148. No sooner had I come down than fear seized the white steed — he ran off then away, and I in grief (left) weak and helpless</p>
<p>149. I lost the sight of my eyes, my figure, my (fair) countenance, and my bloom — (and) I was a poor, blind old man, powerless^ witless, unhonoured !</p>
<p>150. O Patrick, there is for thee my story — as (everything) happened to me without any falsehood — my going away, my adventures in full, and my return from the Land of the Young !</p>
</div>
<p>As well as providing his own translations, Flannery also reviewed several other versions.</p>
<p>For example, he remarked on the first popular translation of the poem:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>But not till 1859 was this fine poem printed — so difficult was it to get anything published in the Irish language. In tnat year it was at length brought before the public by Mr. Brian O’Looney who edited it — with an interesting introduction — for the <em>Irish Ossianic Society</em>, and on the version given by him in the fourth volume of that Society’s <em>Transactions</em>, the present edition is mainly based. But during the hundred years of its unprinted existence, the poem could not fail to be altered, added to, and corrupted. Some of the versions current in the neighbouring counties of Galway and Mayo for instance differ considerably from the first printed edition — some are much longer, some shorter, some worse, a few in some respects better.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Flannery also reviewed other translations that had appeared since the original publication of the poem (which is to say, between 1859 and 1896):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Since 1859 its attractiveness has made it a frequent theme for writers. Mr. O’Looney only gave a literal prose translation of his version ; it was followed in 1860 (or ‘61) by a metrical translation by ‘A Member of the Ossianic Society’ which was published by the late John O’Daly — but it was a most unworthy representation of the Irish poem. Next came Mr. T. D. Sullivan’s very pleasing English poetical version — but it was more a <em>paraphrase</em> than a <em>translation</em>, did not give the whole story, and did not attempt the style or metre of the original. Mr. David Comyn — a namesake, and I believe a scion of the family of the original author, republished the Irish poem in 1880 for the Gaelic Union — keeping too closely however both to Mr. O’Looney’s text and to his translation. But Mr. Comyn only gave a literal translation of the poem, accompanying it certainly with a very useful vocabulary. Now to translate a poem merely word for word, is I hold nothing less than <em>desecration</em> — it is treating it as a mere heap of words, or as a column of a dictionary — ignoring its chief value, namely, as <em>a piece of literature</em>. In his “Old Celtic Romances,” Dr. Joyce gives a very readable but very brief prose summary of the story in English, and recently Mr. W. B. Yeats has published a poem called “The Wanderings of Ossian,” but how far this is a translation of <em>Tír na nÓg</em> , I cannot say, as I have not seen it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Reading through the “unworthy” metrical translation by the member of the Ossianic Society, it’s not hard to see why Flannery didn’t think much of it!</p>

<p>LAY OF OISIN ON THE LAND OF YOUTH, AS RELATED BY HIM TO ST. PATRICK.</p>
<p>P. O brave Oisin ! son of the king !<br />
Of valorous deeds and actions greatest;<br />
I pray, and sadness from thee fling,<br />
How yet thou liv’st that thou relatest.</p>
<p>O. New Patrick, I will tell, tho’ sore,<br />
To tell it thee, and great the trouble<br />
The battle dread of Garva o’er,<br />
Where fell alas ! the Osgar noble.</p>
<p>One day as we assembled were,<br />
Generous Finn and all surviving,<br />
Though mournful is our tale and drear,<br />
In death our gallant heroes leaving.</p>
<p>The borders of Lough Lene along,<br />
As <em>there</em> we coursed in misty morning,<br />
The woods afloat with birds’ sweet song,<br />
And trees and flowers the place adorning.</p>
<p>There we aroused the hornless deer,<br />
Of swiftest foot and lightest bounding,<br />
Our brindled hounds close in the rear,<br />
The nimble animal astounding.</p>
<p>It was not long till we espied,<br />
A rider fleet towards us advancing;<br />
A lily-gleaming lovely maid,<br />
On a swift palfry graceful prancing.</p>
<p>Then from the chase we all did cease,<br />
To a royal maid it was our duty;<br />
And Finn and we did all agree,<br />
We ne’er beheld an equal beauty.</p>
<p>A regal crown adorned her head,<br />
Her flowing robes of silk most precious,<br />
Spangled with stars bright golden-red,<br />
Loose trailed in glittering folds and spacious.</p>
<p>Were golden ringlets dangling down,<br />
Each curling tress as bright and golden,<br />
Her eyes clear blue withouten frown,<br />
Like morning dew drops pure beholden.</p>
<p>Her cheeks were like the unfolding rose,<br />
More graceful she than swan light-swimming,<br />
The nectar her red lips dispose,<br />
Sweeter than sweetest goblets brimming.</p>
<p>Rich were the housings, gorgeous, grand,<br />
That covered her steed the fleetest, whitest,<br />
The saddle pure gold, and in her hand,<br />
A gold-bit bridle, rarest, brightest.</p>
<p>Four shoes well-shaped he stood upon,<br />
Of yellow gold of sheen the fairest,<br />
His head a silver wreath was on,<br />
Of breathing steeds is he the rarest.</p>
<p>O. Full soon to Finn she did repair,<br />
In accents gentle graceful speaking,<br />
” Brave Fenian king,” thus spoke the fair,<br />
“Afar I’ve come thy heroes seeking. “</p>
<p>F. ” Lady, from us conceal not now,<br />
(Of loveliest countenance and meekest,)<br />
Whence thou hast come and who art thou,<br />
And what it is thou lonely seekest.”</p>
<p>“Gold-head Niamh is my name,<br />
O sagest Finn of far famed legions,<br />
Beyond all women is my fame,<br />
The Princess of the Youthful Regions. “</p>
<p>“Then, Princess bright, relate to us,<br />
What afiliction thy bosom presses,<br />
That thy own home thou leavest thus<br />
Has consort thine fled thy caresses ? “</p>
<p>” Not husband mine from me did go,<br />
Nor am I yet to man bespoken;<br />
But famous king of Fenians know<br />
Of love to thy son, this the token. “</p>
<p>“Which of my sons is he whom thou<br />
Hast loved so well, O daughter blooming ?<br />
Let thy narration freely flow<br />
And true concealing nought, sweet woman.</p>
<p>“To thee, brave Finn, I’ll truly tell,<br />
Thy noble son of spirits cheering,<br />
Oisin — of arms high tempered well,<br />
The cause of this my speech thou’rt hearing. “</p>
<p>F. “What is the reason thou’lt assign,<br />
O’er lords that live — of scores the many,<br />
My son thou lov’st — of ringlets fine,<br />
Daughter more beautiful than any ? “</p>
<p>L. ” Brave Fenian king, not without cause<br />
From lands afar I’m thus a roving,<br />
For of his might I’ve heard applause,<br />
And of himself accounts approving.</p>
<p>“Full many a Prince and Chieftain high,<br />
Are there that loved me with affection,<br />
But none to love consented I<br />
Till now Oisin of noblest action. “</p>
<p>O. O Patrick by that hand on thee,<br />
Nor shameful do I deem the telling,<br />
In love was every limb of me,<br />
With that sweet maid of ringlets swelling.</p>
<p>O. In mine I took her lovely hand<br />
And said in tones of speech so sweet, ” thee<br />
I gladly welcome to this land,<br />
And gentle, truly, do I greet thee.</p>
<p>“I bless the happy gladsome hour<br />
On which I met thee, lovely creature,<br />
All living maids, I prize thee o’er,<br />
Thou gentle star of radiant feature. “</p>
<p>L. ” Gen’rous Oisin I bind on thee<br />
By ties no bero true resisteth,<br />
Now on my steed to come with me,<br />
To th’ land where youth for ever existeth.</p>
<p>L. “The most delightful to be found,<br />
And of most gen’rous reputation,<br />
With fruit trees drooping to the ground,<br />
And verdure there without cessation.</p>
<p>“Honey abundant there and wine,<br />
And all that to the eyes are grateful,<br />
Nor shalt thou see age nor decline,<br />
Decay so bald nor death so hateful.</p>
<p>“Feasts, manly sports, and music sweet<br />
Of harpchords most melodious chanting,<br />
And gold and silver, thou shalt get,<br />
Nor costly jewels shall be wanting.</p>
<p>“And richest suit, believe my words,<br />
Of costly silk, and steeds the finest,<br />
An hundred each, and glittering swords,<br />
Thou’lt have, and hounds of scent the keenest.</p>
<p>“The king of youths’ diadem thou’lt get,<br />
In dangers safe I’ll keep thee ever,<br />
For any person living yet,<br />
This diadem he parted never.</p>
<p>“A closely fitting coat of mail,<br />
Thy person from all strokes protecting,<br />
A gold hilt sword that ne’er did fail,<br />
Death to all foes at once inflicting.</p>
<p>Shirts, armour, kine, an hundred each,<br />
And calves and sheep with golden fleeces, —<br />
This world did never witness such,<br />
As jewels thou’lt get an hundred pieces.</p>
<p>O. “An hundred virgins gay and young,<br />
Refulgent as the sun appearing,<br />
Of comeliest forms, — ne’er like them sung,<br />
The sweetest birds, their voice so cheering.</p>
<p>“An hundred heroes shall be thine,<br />
In speed and feats of strength excelling,<br />
In arms and armour bright they shine,<br />
If the Land of Youth thou’lt make thy dwelling.</p>
<p>“All I have promised thou’lt receive,<br />
Besides delights I may not mention;<br />
A life of happiness believe,<br />
With me thy wife of sweet attention. “</p>
<p>“Refusal none from me thou’lt get,<br />
Bright queen of amber ringlets flowing,<br />
The choice of all I ever met,<br />
To the Land of Youth let us be going. “</p>
<p>On the steed’s back before me still,<br />
The virgin sate, without emotion,<br />
” Behave thyself, ” she said ” until<br />
We reach the shore of yonder ocean. “</p>
<p>At once arose the swiftest steed,<br />
When we the ocean’s shore had bordered,<br />
And shook himself and three times neighed,<br />
A preparation to face forward.</p>
<p>When Finn and all the Fenii saw,<br />
The sturdy steed so swiftly journeying.<br />
And close upon the ocean draw<br />
They raised three shouts of grief and mourning.</p>
<p>“Alas, ” said Finn, ” woe is to me,<br />
That thou art thus me lonely leaving,<br />
Whom bravely I ne’er hope to see,<br />
Returning,” spoke Finn slow and grieving.</p>
<p>This form and beauty changed at sight,<br />
And tears ran down in showers flowing,<br />
And wet his breast and visage bright,<br />
“My woe ! ” said he,”Oisin is going ! ” ‘</p>
<p>Our parting from each other then,<br />
Patrick, the son and father hoary—<br />
Without a hope to meet again,<br />
Oh ! ‘tis a melancholy story.</p>
<p>My father did I gently kiss,<br />
Receiving from him the same affection,<br />
And down my cheeks did round tears press,<br />
Adieu to bid that gallant faction !</p>
<p>Delightful days spent Finn and I,<br />
And with us all the Fenii gallant,<br />
And oft at chess our skill did try,<br />
And manly sports — that host once valiant !</p>
<p>In valleys deep a hunting gay,<br />
Our dogs of music-mouth sweet yelling;<br />
At other times in war array,<br />
With vigour heroes lifeless felling.</p>
<p>P. Foolish Oisin, awhile forego<br />
Thy Fenian bravery elating,<br />
How tis thou went we long to know,<br />
Then continue thy tale relating.</p>
<p>O. We turned our backs upon the land,<br />
And right due-west our faces willing,<br />
The sea ebbing before us, and<br />
After we passed the dry space filling.</p>
<p>And many wonders saw we there —<br />
Cities and courts and mansions whitest,<br />
Fortresses too, and castles fair,<br />
Palaces and summer seats the brightest.</p>
<p>We by our sides had seen also<br />
A harmless fawn quite nimbly leaping;<br />
A red-eared hound as white as snow,<br />
A sprightly chace after her keeping.</p>
<p>We saw — nor is it idly planned—<br />
A maiden young a brown steed riding,<br />
A golden apple in her hand,<br />
On the wave tops green she passed us sliding.</p>
<p>After the maiden bounded fast,<br />
A youthful rider costly clothed,<br />
In crimson mantle of sun-red cast,—<br />
Gold-hilt sword he held unsheathed.</p>
<p>Of yonder twain whom yet I see,<br />
O princess mild reveal the mystery;<br />
Of the white steed’s rider pray tell me,<br />
And comely maiden too, the history.</p>
<p>L. Heed not, Oisin, what thou dost see,<br />
Nor wonder thou at any vision,<br />
In them is nothing until we<br />
Have reached the Land of Youth elysian.</p>
<p>O. A sun-bright palace next appeared,<br />
Of noblest shape on the horizon,<br />
A shining front on high it reared,<br />
More beautiful were not set eyes on.</p>
<p>What royal mansion grand is this<br />
Great lasting wonder architectural ?<br />
Say also who its ruler is,<br />
Say I pray thee leave me not conjectural.</p>
<p>The Princess of the Land of Life,<br />
Is in that fortress yet forsaken;<br />
With violent strength of armed strife,<br />
By Fowar Builteach of Dromlough taken.</p>
<p>She, never to make her his wife,<br />
Upon the brave put obligation;<br />
Until with deeds of heroic strife,<br />
Some champion gained her liberation.</p>
<p>Blessings be ever on thee shed,<br />
Sweeter thy voice than best musician,<br />
Sweet Niav of the golden head—<br />
Great is our grief at her condition.</p>
<p>Come to the fortress her to see,<br />
And then despite his best endeavour,<br />
That giant great shall fall by me,<br />
In feats of strength as mine were ever.</p>
<p>Into the fortress then we went,<br />
And the young princess came to greet us,<br />
To her beaming face our way we bent,<br />
With many welcomes did she meet us.</p>
<p>O. Apparel of yellow silk was on<br />
The queen of beauty rare excelling,<br />
Her skin as white as any swan,<br />
Her cheeks surpass the poet’s telling.</p>
<p>Her hair fair shone, a golden hue,<br />
Her eyes clear blue were purely beaming,<br />
As berries her honeyed lips to view,<br />
Her browslike heaven’s arch radiant gleaming.</p>
<p>On soft arm chairs of glinting gold,<br />
We sat before a sumptuous table,<br />
Which flasks and viands did copious hold,<br />
Of nectarine <em>beoir</em> so sweet and sable.</p>
<p>And when much wines sweet-flavoured, and<br />
Refreshment else, we all had taken,<br />
Then spoke the mild young Princess bland,<br />
And bade us to her story hearken.</p>
<p>The secrets of her tale she told Us,<br />
and the tears came freely flowing,<br />
She said, ” while livest the giant bold,<br />
To my own home I can’t be going. “</p>
<p>” Be silent, fair young Princess, and<br />
Give up thy mourning and thy grieving;<br />
For here I pledge to thee my hand,<br />
The giant shall not long be living. “</p>
<p>” There is not a champion in the land,<br />
Of best repute the bright sun under,<br />
That could give battle hand to hand,<br />
To th’ giant of the blows of thunder. “</p>
<p>O. ” Assure thyself, I promise thee<br />
That I am not in dread to try him,<br />
And if that he fall not by me,<br />
In thy defence I will fall by him. “</p>
<p>Ere long we saw approaching near,<br />
The hideous giant, him did environ,<br />
A weighty load of skins of deer,<br />
— And in his hand a club of iron.</p>
<p>Most rudely did he pass us by,<br />
At the young damsel looking coldly,<br />
Fierce conflict he proclaimed, and I<br />
Myself, to meet him, stalked forth boldly.</p>
<p>Three days and nights we fiercely fought<br />
In contest great without abating,<br />
And then I to the ground him brought,<br />
His head and trunk first separating.</p>
<p>And when the maidens saw him low,<br />
And that to Hades dark was he sent,<br />
Their gladness they did not forego,<br />
But gave it vent in gay merriment.</p>
<p>Our way we backwards slowly bent,<br />
For weak was I — my strength quite losing,<br />
And shedding blood, for fast it went<br />
From out my wounds, most copious oozing.</p>
<p>The Daughter of the King of Life<br />
In truth, to my assistance hasted,<br />
And cured the wounds that in the strife<br />
I got, nor longer strength I wasted.</p>
<p>We on our feast with pleasure fared,<br />
And we were glad and merry after;<br />
For us were beds of down prepared,<br />
And warmer none could be, nor softer.</p>
<p>The monster we interred, —the grave<br />
Was wide and deep in which I placed him;<br />
I wrote his name in Ogham Craobh,<br />
When tomb and tomb-stone high I raised him.</p>
<p>Soon as the dawn auroral rose,<br />
And drowsiness fled each sensation,<br />
The Princess briskly did propose,<br />
That we’d set out to our destination.</p>
<p>So we prepared ourselves in haste,<br />
Our leave of the young lady taking,<br />
And sorrow in each face was traced,<br />
As we each other were forsaking.</p>
<p>O Patrick mild ! I cannot say<br />
What did occur to her, or whether<br />
To the Land of Life she made her way,<br />
For since we saw not one another.</p>
<p>P. Pleasant Oisin, thou didst not tell<br />
What country ‘twas which thou wert travelling<br />
Its name to us O pray reveal,<br />
And continue thy tale unravelling.</p>
<p>O. The Land of Virtues is its name,<br />
And well’s the appellation given,<br />
Your God with love I’d praise, if the same<br />
Glories as there are, be in heaven.</p>
<p>O. Our faces homewards soon we turned,<br />
Our horse with us in full speed going,<br />
And swifter he the dull earth spurned,<br />
Than feet march winds over mountains blowing.</p>
<p>The firmament frowned dark e’er long,<br />
With fury fierce the wind was blowing,<br />
The raging sea lashed wild and strong,<br />
The sun his bright face was not showing.</p>
<p>Awhile amazed upon the clouds<br />
We gazed, that cloaked the stars thick under;<br />
The storm abated, and the shrouds<br />
Encircling Phoebus, split asunder.</p>
<p>A most delightful country we<br />
Beheld close by, — were flowers blowing<br />
Along its plains exuberantly,<br />
And forts we saw their battlements showing.</p>
<p>No colour ever eye has seen,<br />
Of richest blue or white the whitest,<br />
Of purple, crimson, yellow, green,<br />
But blending glimmered here the brightest.</p>
<p>And plentiful all round were there<br />
Summer seats and palaces radiant,<br />
By skilful artist made they were<br />
Of precious stones without ingredient.</p>
<p>Approached us slow in solemn throng,<br />
And welcomed us a deputation,<br />
One hundred and fifty champions strong,<br />
Of greatest speed and reputation.</p>
<p>O. ” What beautiful country, speak the truth,<br />
That eyes have any-where beholden—<br />
O say, is that the Land of Youth,<br />
Thou gentle maid of ringlets golden ? “</p>
<p>” Generous Oisin, it is truly—<br />
A lie of it I told you never,<br />
Nor aught I promised e’er to thee,<br />
But certainly is thine for ever. ‘</p>
<p>Approaching then did we behold<br />
An hundred beauteous maidens blooming,<br />
Their dresses dazzling bright with gold,<br />
To their blest country me welcoming.</p>
<p>An escort multitudinous,<br />
Led by a king of might and power,<br />
Advanced and kindly welcomed us—<br />
Was manly grace his natal dower.</p>
<p>And regal robes adorning bright,<br />
His beauteous person, flowed serenely,<br />
A crown of diamond-glowing light<br />
Twinkled upon his head so sheenly.</p>
<p>And soon advanced the youthful Queen,<br />
By fifty lovely maids attended,<br />
Of nature’s sweetest mould I ween,<br />
In whom the rose and lily blended.</p>
<p>And being arrived where we were in,<br />
Thus spoke the King of Youths delighted :
” Behold, Oisin, brave son of Finn,<br />
To Niav his troth will soon be plighted. “</p>
<p>O. He said, and loud his voice did ring,<br />
And clasped my hand,<br />
O friendship thro’ thee,<br />
” O brave Oisin, son of the King,<br />
An hundred thousand welcomes to thee. “</p>
<p>” Here in this Land where thou hast come,<br />
Solace thine heart with the happy tiding<br />
Thy life shall be a life of bloom,<br />
Long durable in youth abiding.</p>
<p>“For in this golden Land of Youth,<br />
All pleasures unconceived await thee,<br />
As thou shalt <em>know</em> in very sooth,<br />
Although these joys will never <em>sate</em> thee. “</p>
<p>And more, I now present to thee,<br />
Gold-headed Niav my own daughter,<br />
Who that her consort thou wouldst be,<br />
For thee afar sped over the water. “</p>
<p>My thanks I tendered to the King,<br />
And to the Princess fair bowed loyal<br />
Soon did a pleasant journey bring<br />
Us to the glittering mansion royal.</p>
<p>And nobles from the palace then,<br />
Both men and women came to meet us,<br />
And with a feast ambrosial, ten<br />
Grand days and nights they well did treat us.</p>
<p>Espoused I Niav then in sooth,<br />
Sweet Patrick of the long oration;<br />
Thus went I to the Land of Youth,<br />
And sorrowful is my narration.</p>
<p>P. Thy tale continue for us yet,<br />
Oisin of the golden arms slaying,<br />
From th’ Land of Youth how thou didst get,<br />
I think it long till thou art saying.</p>
<p>So with great pleasure tell us now,<br />
By Niav hadst thou any children;<br />
I’the Land of Youth how long wert thou,<br />
Relate us without grief bewildering.</p>
<p>O. By Niav I had children three,<br />
Of fairest form and countenance cheering,<br />
Two blooming sons both bold and free,<br />
And daughter sweet and mild appearing.</p>
<p>Long time I spent with pleasure fraught,<br />
Three hundred years and over, giving,<br />
To happiness, until I thought,<br />
I’d wish to see the Fenii living.</p>
<p>P. Pleasant Oisin, yet continue,<br />
And tell thy children’s situation,<br />
Their names give us, and tell us too,<br />
The land which is their present station.</p>
<p>O. The Lands of ” Virtue,” ” Life,<br />
” and ” Youth,”<br />
And countless riches them awaited,<br />
Of kingly gold a crown and wreath,<br />
And jewels that misers might have sated.</p>
<p>And Niav on my sons bestowed.<br />
My father’s name and my son’s daring,<br />
Most noble Finn the army’s head,<br />
And Osgar of the red arms glaring.</p>
<p>O. I myself, gave my daughter fair,<br />
The ‘propriate name of “Flower of Women,”<br />
In virtue of her beauty rare,<br />
So sweet, so comely, and so blooming.</p>
<p>The king’s consent, I asked for then,<br />
And Niav’s too — the golden headed,<br />
To visit Erin sweet again,<br />
His hosts and Finn to see, —once dreaded.</p>
<p>” My leave thou’lt get,” the princess said,<br />
” Though grievous that we should have parted,<br />
Lest home indeed when once thou’rt sped,<br />
Thou’lt not return, Oisin kindhearted. “</p>
<p>My blooming wife, what dost thou dread,<br />
Whilst I the white steed am commanding ?<br />
Him back to thee, I’ll safely lead,<br />
And here again thou’lt see me landing.</p>
<p>L. “Oisin remember what I say—<br />
If to the ground one foot thou givest,<br />
Thou’lt not return hither aye—<br />
To this fine country which thou leavest.</p>
<p>“I say again, and say in truth,<br />
If thou off th’ white steed once alightest.<br />
Thou’lt never see the Land of Youth,<br />
Golden Oisin, of arms the brightest.</p>
<p>” And this third time I caution thee,<br />
If thou off th’ white steed take’st thy pressure,<br />
Blind, old, and feeble thou shalt be,<br />
<em>Sans</em> strength, activity or pleasure.</p>
<p>O. “My woel my grief ! oh ! sweet Oisin,<br />
To Erin green that thou dost flee o’er,<br />
For ‘tis not now as it has been,<br />
His hosts and Finn thou ne’er shalt see more.</p>
<p>“In Erin now thou’lt all things miss,<br />
But hosts of saints — thou’lt see <em>them</em> ever,<br />
Loving Oisin — one parting kiss !<br />
To the Land of Youth thou’lt comeback never ! “</p>
<p>I looked with pity in her face,<br />
And down my cheeks ran tears thick-streaming,<br />
Oh ! thou would’st mourn to see her case,<br />
Tearing the hair off her head gold-gleaming.</p>
<p>To go and come, nor touch the lea,<br />
She under strict injunctions bound me—<br />
But if I broke them, she told me,<br />
My friends would ne’er again surround me.</p>
<p>All which I promised her indeed,<br />
To carefully fulfill, nor doubt me,<br />
And then I crossed my fleet white steed,<br />
And bade farewell to all about me.</p>
<p>I kissed my gentle consort fair,<br />
And grieved was I at th’ separation<br />
My two sons and my daughter were<br />
Shedding salt tears, without cessation.</p>
<p>Soon did the curling mane arise,<br />
As the proud courser bounded onward,<br />
Fleet as the eagle skims the skies,<br />
Smooth as a frigate sailing landward.</p>
<p>O. Our story is not fully told,<br />
Of all to us that had a bearing,<br />
Till Erin green we did behold,<br />
The many-jewelled sweet green Erin.</p>
<p>We never told you an untruth,<br />
O ! Patrick of the saints and orders,<br />
But how we left the Land of Youth,<br />
Related, as all true recorders.</p>
<p>O ! Patrick if myself had been,<br />
As when I came, green Erin seeking,<br />
From death thy clerics nought could screen,<br />
I’d headless leave each body reeking.</p>
<p>If bread enough thou gavest me,<br />
As Finn at all times would have given—<br />
Over it safe to strengthen thee,<br />
I’d pray unto thy King of Heaven.</p>
<p>P. ” Not cause of one complaint thou’lt get,<br />
But meat and drink unto thy filling,<br />
So continue thy story yet,<br />
For thy sweet voice, what music thrilling. “</p>
<p>O. When I arrived in Erin green,<br />
Close search I made in all directions,<br />
But sought in vain — his hosts and Finn,<br />
For me left nothing but afflictions.</p>
<p>Exploring thus — it chanced one day,<br />
That in the distance were appearing,<br />
A troop of men, and women gay,<br />
And soon my person they were nearing.</p>
<p>O: They courteously saluted me,<br />
And at me gazed with admiration,<br />
As every one did closely scan<br />
My form with deepest penetration.</p>
<p>Any account if they could give<br />
Of Finn, I asked them at last, or<br />
Did any of the Fenians live,<br />
Or what their final great disaster. “</p>
<p>“We often have heard tell of Finn—<br />
That he surpassed in strength full many,<br />
In person, character and mien,<br />
Was never equalled yet by any. “</p>
<p>“In many a book is written down,<br />
By sweetest bards, green Erin’s sages,<br />
What we’re unable to make known<br />
The deeds of Finn and former ages.</p>
<p>” And we have heard he had a son,<br />
In strength surpassing now-a-day legions;<br />
Who to the Land of Youth had gone,<br />
With the Young Princess of those regions. “</p>
<p>O. Nor Finn, nor one brave hero lived<br />
Oh ! when I heard that story fully,<br />
I was with greatest sorrow grieved,<br />
And full of stupid melancholy.</p>
<p>Without delay I steered my way,<br />
Setting my face direct to Allvuin,<br />
In Leinster of the ample sway<br />
Where oft great deeds were acted well in.</p>
<p>O. And great was my astonishment,<br />
Finn’s court that I could not discover,<br />
’Twas gone and to discernment,<br />
Were — wastes with nettles flowing over.</p>
<p>Alas, O Patrick, and alas !<br />
No hopeful word of Finn receiving,<br />
To me no pleasant journey ‘t was<br />
Through life it leaves me sorely grieving.</p>
<p>P. Oisin desist from this thy grief,<br />
And shed thy tears to th’ God of graces,<br />
The Fenii all are weak enough,<br />
And joy their sorrow ne’er replaces.</p>
<p>O. A greater pity could not be,<br />
Than Finn in agony for ever,<br />
Who over him gained such victory,<br />
That slaying heroes was most clever ?</p>
<p>P. Tis God that gained the victory,<br />
On whom tis useless to resent it,<br />
And all the Fenians and he,<br />
Condemned to hell, are there tormented.</p>
<p>O. O ! Patrick do direct me where,<br />
The Fenii brave are so afflicted,<br />
And not a heaven or a hell is there,<br />
That long can keep them, weak subjected.</p>
<p>If my brave son were on the sod,<br />
Who oft in battle dealt sore anguish<br />
There’s not in hell nor i’ th’ heaven of God,<br />
A host though great he would not vanquish.</p>
<p>P. Arguing not — let us agree,<br />
Valiant Oisin, and thy narration,<br />
Continue, what occurred to thee,<br />
I wish to hear on that occasion.</p>
<p>O. Patrick the facts I will not screen<br />
Not long in lonely Allvuin staying<br />
The favourite resorts of Finn.<br />
Well did I search without delaying.</p>
<p>And Glenasmole when passing o’er<br />
Numbers of men I saw together,<br />
Three hundred men were there or more,<br />
Appearing busy on the heather.</p>
<p>And one of the assembly said,<br />
And in a lusty voice he said it<br />
” O princely hero lend us aid,<br />
And save us from great dangers dreaded. “</p>
<p>In coming forward I did lag<br />
Not — and they had a flag of marble,<br />
And they did lift the weighty flag,<br />
But to uphold were unable.</p>
<p>And they were grievously oppressed,<br />
And weak who were the great flag under,<br />
And by its weight were sore distressed,<br />
And senseless many it did render.</p>
<p>Thus did a steward me accost,<br />
” O princely stout and youthful hero,<br />
Forthwith relieve my struggling host,<br />
Or shortly they’re not worth a Zero. “</p>
<p>O. How strange it is, and shameful that,<br />
( And the great number that if you are,<br />
The strength of you combined is not,<br />
Enough to lift this flag with power.</p>
<p>Had Osgar lived ——Oisin’s brave son,<br />
He’d take this flag and fling it duly,<br />
And with one hand — and when ‘twas done,<br />
He’d think it nought,— I speak but truly.</p>
<p>To my right side I forward leant,<br />
And took the flag and raised it o’er me,<br />
And seven perches then I sent,<br />
It reeling with great strength before me.</p>
<p>Then did the golden girth give way,<br />
For by the flag’s great force ‘ twas broken,<br />
Thus I became to age a prey,<br />
As doth my silvered head betoken.</p>
<p>No sooner did I touch the ground,<br />
Than the white steed like light’ning started,<br />
And back his way he quickly found,<br />
And left me lonely broken-hearted.</p>
<p>Alas ! my eye-sight quickly ran,<br />
From me — no comeliness commanding,<br />
I did become both old and wan,<br />
Sans strength esteem or understanding.</p>
<p>And Patrick there is now in truth,<br />
The faithful story of my journeying,<br />
And my adventures in th ‘ Land of Youth,<br />
As well as also my returning . —</p>

<p>Tír Na Nóg — The Land of Youth</p>
<p>TO
WILLIAM SMITH O’BRIEN, ESQ.,
PRESIDENT OF THE OSSIANIC SOCIETY.</p>
<p>Sir,— Pursuant to your wishes, and at your very kind suggestion, I have undertaken the following translation of the Ossianic poem, on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">n-Óg</span></code> (” Land of Youth,”) in the humble but confident hope that I may, however, unpretending as an Irish scholar, be in some measure instrumental in restoring our <em>neglected lore</em> to its former style and standard.</p>
<p>From my knowledge of the Fenian stories, and Ossianic poems which circulate in this country, I would classify them under three different and distinct heads, 1st, Fenian history, which comprises all based upon fact aand supported by the ancient records and chronicles of our country, such as Cac 5A5ttA, Caz Cquca and the like, which it would be absurd to discredit against the forcible evidence of our trustworthy annals. 2nd, inventions and poetic Actions which are entertaining, and intended by the authors more to amuse the reader and to embellish history, than, as some say, to impose on his understanding, and claim the credit of truth. 3rd, the poems and prophecies of f 101717, Coftt]oU, CAO^lce, and others of the flAiyi)^ 6}ftiooi9 (Irish Militia), which are very interesting, and I should think entitled to as much credit as the early traditions of any other nation.</p>
<p>Some assume that the genuine old poems and stories cannot be distinguished from the modern Actions, and consequently that they cannot be credited, but that all must be considered worthless. This is a very unjustifiable assumption. The Irish scholar will at once know the composition of the Fenian period, as the language and style is different from that of latter times. From the fourteenth to the beginning of the eighteenth century, we bare another dais of poems and romantic tales, which exhibit a later stage of the language, but which are well worthy of attention. My own convlcton is that the Ossianic poem on the ” Land of Youth” is of this last class and date, and from the testimony of many corroborating facts supported by the result of an inquiry which I instituted at your suggestion, I believe it to have been written by the learned Michael Comyn, contemporaneously with the romance of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Torolv</span> <span class="pre">mac</span> <span class="pre">Starn</span></code> (Torolv the son of Starn), about the year A.D. 1749. By comparing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">n-Óg</span></code> with the occasionally interspersed verses in the romance of Torolv the son of Starn, Sec, whose author is universally acknowledged to be Michael Comyc, it will be perceived that there is such a similarity and almost identity of style in them as to leave no doubt that they are both the productions of the same master mind. As further proof of this I may state that an illiterate man of my acquaintance can repeat several verses of it, but knows it under no other name but that of Laio An Coimin (Comyn’s Lay) and that his father had it from Comyn’s manuscript. Another man states in a letter to me, that his copy of it was written in the year 1762 by a celebrated Irish scholar, who lived in Ruan, County of Glare. In this poem we have an account of Cf n 9A fh^Aome itfAjt^ (Land of the good people), the elysium of the Pagan Irish as related to St. Patrick by Oisin, when he returned to Erin after a lapse of more than three hundred years, which he spent in the enjoyment of all bliss, with his charming spouse, the golden headed (haired) Niamh. While Oisin sojourned in the paradise of perpetual youth, it was (it seems falsely) said of him that he was dead, but as those who enter the ” Land of the Just” can never die, so Oisin lived until he returned to relate the history of his adventures, and of this happy elysium. The inhabitants, of the eastern countries believed that in the west there was a happy final abode for the just which was called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">????</span></code> (Land of the good people.)</p>
<p>This elysium is supposed to be divided into different states and provinces, each governed by its own king or ruler, such <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">n-Óg</span></code> (Land of youth) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">????</span></code> (Land of the Living) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">???</span></code> (Land of virtues) and several others. According to traditional geography and history the “Land of Youth” is the most charming country to be found or imagined, abounding in all that fancy could suggest or man could desire, and bestowing the peculiar virtue of perpetual youth, and hence the name. In the ” Land of Virtues,” or as some call it, the “Land of Victories” (but the latter name I suppose to be a mis-translation, as I have never heard of a battle or strife in this country); it is all peace, tranquility and happiness. As there is no conflict there can be no victory— and there is no virtue to be desired which is not to be had on entering this country ! The ” Land of life” is supposed to give perpetual life to the departed spirits of the just. These are supposed to be located somewhere about the sun’s setting point, and have means of approach, chiefly through the seas, lakes and rivers of this world, also through raths, duns and forts. The seas, lakes and riyers act as cooling atmospheres, while the raths, duns and forts, serve as places of ingress and egress to and from them. There are besides, different grand-gates, as it were, through, out the world, such asQU ScuinQ (Kill Stuifin), situate in liscannor Bey, supposed to be one of the chief entrances into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">n-Óg</span></code> (” Land of youth.”) This is said to be abeautiftil but small city, marked by the white breaking waves between Iaacc (Lahinch.) and lTor-CeAi)i7i&amp;in (Liscannor). The white breaking wares, which are always seen in this part of the Bay, are said to be caused by the shallowness of the water over this enchanted little city, which is beliered to be seen once in seven years, and of which, it is observed, that those who see it shall depart this world before the lapse of seven years to come ; but it is not supposed that those persons die but change their abode, and transmigrate from this world of toil, into the elysium of the just, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">n-Óg</span></code> (” Land of Youth,”) where they shall, at once, become sportive, young and happy, and continue so for ever. It is also believed, that those who see those enchanted spots, are slightly endowed with the gift of prophecy, from the time they see it till they depart this world, and that they pass through this enchanted passage, so magically shewn them, prior to their departure. For further information on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Cill</span> <span class="pre">Stuifin</span></code> (Kill Stuifin), read Comyn’s Romance, called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">??</span> <span class="pre">Torolv</span> <span class="pre">maic</span> <span class="pre">Staimn</span> <span class="pre">???</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">???</span> <span class="pre">mac</span></code> (the adventures of Torolv Mac Starn and his three sons). Contiguous to this place is another spot called C90C oa nos^^e (Fairy Hill), this was the ancient name of Lahinch, before the death of the Chieftain, O’Connor of Dumhach, (the Sand pits), who had been treacherously slain there, and in memory of whom there had been raised a monument called leAcc uj Coq- cubATft (O’Connor’s monument), which in Irish is the present name of this little town, but in its anglicised form Lahinch, or Lahinchy, it has lost all sight of the old derivation. It was called Cooc pA 5105x60 (Fairy Hill), from its being the meeting place of the fairy nobles of this section of the country, who, it seems, lived on terms of intercourse with the nobles of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tir</span> <span class="pre">na</span> <span class="pre">n-Óg</span></code> (“Land of Youth,”) and this hill is traditionally believed to be the place where both tribes met and held their periodical conferences. The nobles of this country are said to live in the great and large duns, fortresses, lisses, and raths, and to act as agents to the nobles of Cfft 17A 9.65 (” Land of Youth,”) and to those of all the states of the lower paradise. One of the duties of their station is to mark the persons suitable to the lower country, and by their supernatural power they meet or send messengers to carry off those persons. It is in the shape of a beautiful lady, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Niam</span> <span class="pre">Cinn</span> <span class="pre">oir</span></code> golden-headed, (haired) Niamh, that this messenger is generally seen. After the human creature whom she has visited has seen her, she vanishes in some magic way, and goes back to her own country. Ere long the person visited will pine away by some formal disease, and will be said to die, but fairy tradition proves that he or she (whichever it may be), does not die, but that they go into this elysium, where they will become young again and live for ever.</p>
<p>There are several such passages in this country, to describe which, would be both needless and endless. Suffice it to mention a few of the greatest celebrity— 16 or fb bfteAfAl (0<em>Breasail</em>s country), lb lefcfij, (0*Leihin’s country), Inchiquin and Lough Gur. The great Earl of Desmond is supposed to have been submerged in the latter, where he is seen once in every seven years, anxiously awaiting the destined hour of return to his country. On reference to the ancient records and Pagan history of different nations, it will be seen that they have their traditions of Pagan elysiums as well as Ireland.</p>

<p>LAY OF OISIN ON THE LAND OF YOUTHS ;</p>
<p>AS HE RELATED IT TO SAINT PATRICK.</p>
<p>P. O ! Noble Oisin, O ! son of the king !<br />
Of greatest actions, valor, and conflicts,<br />
Belate to us now without despondency,<br />
How thou livedst after the Fians ?</p>
<p>O. I will tell it thee, O Patrick ! lately arrived,<br />
Though mournful to me to say it aloud :—<br />
” After the hard battle of Gabhra,<br />
In which was killed, alas ! the noble Oscar.</p>
<p>One day we, the Fianna, were all assembled,<br />
Generous Fionn and all of us that lived were there ;<br />
Tho’ dark and mournful was our story,<br />
After our heroes being overcome.</p>
<p>We were hunting on a misty morning<br />
Nigh the bordering shores of Loch Léin,<br />
Where thro’ fragrant trees of sweetest blossoms,<br />
And the mellow music of birds at all times.</p>
<p>We aroused the hornless deer<br />
Of the best bounding, course, and agility ;<br />
Our hounds and all our dogs<br />
Were close after in full chase.</p>

<p>O. ‘Twas not long ‘till we saw, westwards,<br />
A fleet rider advancing towards us,<br />
A young maiden of most beautiful appearance.<br />
On a slender white steed of swiftest power.</p>
<p>We all ceased firom the chase,<br />
On seeing the form of the royal maid ;<br />
‘Twas a surprise to Fionn and the Fianns,<br />
They never beheld a woman equal in beauty.</p>
<p>A royal crown was on her head ;<br />
And a brown mantle of precious silk.<br />
Spangled with stars of red gold,<br />
Covering her shoes down to the grass.</p>
<p>A gold ring was hanging down<br />
From each yellow curl <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Perhaps</span> <span class="pre">flguratitvely</span> <span class="pre">meaning</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">snch</span> <span class="pre">curl</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">like</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">loop</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">gold.]</span></code> of her golden hair ;<br />
Her eyes blue, clear, and cloudless,<br />
Like a dew drop on the top of the grass.</p>
<p>Redder were her cheeks than the rose,<br />
Fairer was her visage than the swan upon the wave,<br />
And more sweet was the taste of her balsam lips<br />
Than honey mingled thro’ red wine.</p>
<p>A garment wide, long, and smooth.<br />
Covered the white steed ;<br />
There was a comely saddle of red gold,<br />
And her right hand held a bridle with a golden bit.</p>
<p>Four shoes well shaped were under him,<br />
Of the yellow gold of the purest quality ;<br />
A silver wreath was on the back of his head.<br />
And there was not in the world a steed better.</p>
<p>O. She came to the presence of Fionn,<br />
And spoke with a voice sweet and gentle,<br />
And she said, ” O, king of the Fianna,<br />
Long and distant is my journey, now.”</p>
<p>F. ” Who art thou, thyself, O youthful princess !<br />
Of fairest form, beauty, and countenance,<br />
Relate to us the cause of thy story,<br />
Thine own name and thy country.”</p>
<p>” Golden-headed Niamh is my name,<br />
0, sage Fionn of the great hosts.<br />
Beyond the women of the world I have won esteem,<br />
I am the fair daughter of the King of Youth.”</p>
<p>F. ” Relate to us O amiable princess<br />
What caused thee to come afar across the sea—<br />
Is it thy consort has forsaken thee,<br />
Or what is the affliction that is on thyself.”</p>
<p>N. ” ‘Tis not my husband that went from me,<br />
And as yet I have not been spoken of with any man, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[i.e.</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">have</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">been</span> <span class="pre">betrothed</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">any</span> <span class="pre">man]</span></code><br />
O ! king of the Fianna of highest repute,<br />
But affection and love I have given to thy son.”</p>
<p>” Which of my children [is he] O blooming daughter.<br />
To whom thou hast given love, or yet affection—<br />
Do not conceal from us now the cause,<br />
And relate to us thy case, O woman.”</p>
<p>“I will tell thee that, O Fionn !<br />
Thy noble son of the well-tempered arms,<br />
High-spirited Oisin of the powerfdl bands,<br />
Is the champion that I am now speaking of.”</p>
<p>O. ” What is the reason that thou gavest love.<br />
O ! beautiful daughter of the glossy hair,<br />
To my own son beyond all,<br />
And multitudes of high lords under the sun.”</p>
<p>” ‘Tis not without cause, O, king of the Fianna !<br />
I came afar for him—<br />
But reports I heard of his prowess,<br />
The goodness of his person and his mien.”</p>
<p>” Many a son of a king and a high chief<br />
Gave me affection and perpetual love ;<br />
I never consented to any man<br />
‘Till I gave love to noble Oisin.”</p>
<p>” By that hand on thee, O Patrick,<br />
Though it is not shameful to me as a story.<br />
There was not a limb of me but was in love<br />
With the beautiful daughter of the glossy hair.”</p>
<p>I took her hand in mine.<br />
And said in speech of sweetest tone,<br />
” A true, gentle, welcome before thee,<br />
O young princess to this country !”</p>
<p>” ‘Tis thou that art the brightest and the fairest of form,<br />
‘Tis thee I prefer as wife<br />
Thou art my choice beyond the women of the world<br />
O mild star of loveliest countenance !”</p>
<p>” Obligations unresisted by true heroes<br />
O generous Oisin I put upon thee<br />
To come with myself now upon my steed<br />
Till we arrive at the ‘ Land of Youth.’</p>
<p>O. ” It is the most delightful country to be found,<br />
Of greatest repute under the sun<br />
Trees drooping with fruit and blossom<br />
And foliage growing on the tops of boughs.</p>
<p>” Abundant, there, are honey and wine<br />
And everything that eye has beheld,<br />
There will not come decline on thee with lapse of time,<br />
Death or decay thou wilt not see.</p>
<p>” Thou wilt get feasts, playing, and drink,<br />
Thou wilt get melodious music on the harp strings,<br />
Thou wilt get silver and gold,<br />
Thou wilt get also many jewels.</p>
<p>” Thou wilt get, without falsehood, a hundred swords ;<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred satin garments of precious silk,<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred horses the swiftest in conflict.<br />
And thou wilt get a hundred with them of keen hounds.</p>
<p>” Thou wilt get the royal diadem of the ‘ King of Youth,’<br />
Which he never yet gave to any person under the sun,<br />
‘Twill protect thee both night and day,<br />
In battle, in tumult, and in rough conflict.</p>
<p>” Thou wilt get a fitting coat of protecting mail<br />
And a gold headed sword apt for strokes,<br />
From which no person ever escaped alive<br />
Who, once, saw the sharp weapon.</p>
<p>” Thou wilt get a hundred coats of armour and shirts of satin,<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred cows and, also, an hundred calves,<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred sheep, with their golden fleeces,<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred jewels not in this world.</p>
<p>O. ” Thou wilt get a hundred virgins gay and young<br />
Blight, refulgent, like the sun.<br />
Of best fonn, shape, and appearance,<br />
Whose voices are sweeter than the music of birds.</p>
<p>” Thou wilt get a hundred heroes most powerful in conflict,<br />
And also most expert in feats of agility,<br />
In arms and armour waiting on thee<br />
In the ‘ Land of Youth’ if thou wilt come with me.</p>
<p>” Thou will get everything I promised thee <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[+</span> <span class="pre">Every</span> <span class="pre">verse</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">mark</span> <span class="pre">(+)</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">taken</span> <span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">MS.</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">lately</span> <span class="pre">got,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">MS.</span> <span class="pre">transcribed</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">president</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Mr.</span> <span class="pre">Griffin's</span> <span class="pre">copy.]</span></code><br />
And delights, also, which I may not mention.<br />
Thou wilt get beauty, strength, and power,<br />
And I myself will be thy wife.”</p>
<p>” No refusal will I give from me,<br />
charming queen of the golden curls !<br />
Thou art my choice above the women of the world,<br />
And I will go, with willingness, to the ‘Land of<br />
Youth.’ “</p>
<p>On the back of the steed we went together,<br />
Before me sat the virgin ;<br />
. She said: ” Oisin let us remain quiet,<br />
Till we reach the mouth of the great sea.”</p>
<p>Then arose the steed swiftly,<br />
When we arrived on the borders of the strand<br />
He shook himself then to pace forward.<br />
And neighed three times aloud.</p>
<p>When Fionn and the Fianna saw.<br />
The steed travelling swiftly.<br />
Facing against the great tide.<br />
They raised three shouts of mourning and grief.</p>
<p>O. “O Oisin!” said Fionn slowly and sorrowfully,<br />
” Woe it is to me that thou art going from me,<br />
I have not a hope that thou wilt ever again.<br />
Come back to me victorious.”</p>
<p>His form and beauty changed,<br />
And showers of tears flowed down,<br />
Till they wet his breast and his bright visage<br />
And he said, ” My woe art thou, O, Oisin ! in going<br />
from me.”</p>
<p>O Patrick, ‘twas a melancholy story<br />
Our parting from each other in that place.<br />
The parting of the father from his own son—<br />
‘Tis mournful, weak, and faint to be relating it !</p>
<p>I kissed my father sweetly and gently,<br />
And the same affection I got from him ;<br />
I bade adieu to all the Fianna,<br />
And the Tears flowed down my cheeks.</p>
<p>Many a delightful day had Fionn and I,<br />
And the Fianna with us in great power,<br />
Been chess-playing and drinking,<br />
And hearing music—the host that was powerful !</p>
<p>A hunting in smooth valleys.<br />
And our sweet-mouthed dogs with us there ;<br />
At other times, in the rough conflicf,<br />
Slaughtering heroes with great vigour.</p>
<p>P. O ! foolish Oisin, forego a while<br />
Thy great actions of the Fenians,<br />
How didst thou go to the ” Land of Youth,”<br />
Proceed, faithfully, with thy tale to us.</p>
<p>O. We turned our backs to the land<br />
And our faces directly due-west.<br />
The smooth sea ebbed before us,<br />
And filled in billows after us.</p>
<p>We saw wonders in our travels,<br />
Cities, courts and castles,<br />
Lime-white mansions and fortresses.<br />
Brilliant summer-houses and palaces.</p>
<p>We saw also, by our sides<br />
A hornless fawn leaping nimbly,<br />
And a red-eared white dog,<br />
Urging it boldly in the chase.</p>
<p>We beheld also, without fiction,<br />
A young maid on a brown steed,<br />
A golden apple in her right hand,<br />
And she going on the top of the waves.</p>
<p>We saw after her,<br />
A young rider on a white steed.<br />
Under a purple, crimson mantle of satin.<br />
And a gold-headed sword in his right hand,</p>
<p>” Who are yon two whom I see,<br />
O gentle princess, tell me the meaning,<br />
That woman of most beautiful countenance,<br />
And the comely rider of the white steed.”</p>
<p>” Heed not what thou wilt see,<br />
O gentle Oisin, nor what thou hast yet seen.<br />
There is in them but nothing,<br />
Till we reach tiie land of the ‘ King of Youth.’ “</p>
<p>O. We saw from us afar<br />
A sunny palace of beantiful front,<br />
Its form and appearance were the most beauteous<br />
That were to be found in the world “</p>
<p>” What exceeding—fine, royal mansion,<br />
And also, the best that eye hath seen,<br />
Is this, that we are travelling near to.<br />
Or who is high-chief of that place ? “</p>
<p>“The daughter of the king of the ‘ Land of Life,’<br />
Is queen, yet, in that fortress<br />
She was taken by Fomhor Builleach <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Fomhor</span> <span class="pre">Builleach,</span> <span class="pre">i.e.</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">striking</span> <span class="pre">Giant,</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">despotic</span> <span class="pre">ruler</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span> <span class="pre">Land</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Virtues,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">—</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">country</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">mentioned</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">any</span> <span class="pre">other</span> <span class="pre">copy</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">poem</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">have</span> <span class="pre">seen.]</span></code>, of Dromloghach,<br />
With violent strength of arms and activity.</p>
<p>” Obligation she put upon the brave,<br />
Never to make her a wife,<br />
Till she got a champion or true hero.<br />
To stand battle with him hand to hand.”</p>
<p>” Take success and blessings, O golden-headed Niamh,<br />
I have never heard better music<br />
Than the gentle voice of thy sweet mouth,<br />
Great grief to us is a woman of her condition.</p>
<p>” I will go now to visit her to the fortress.<br />
And it may be for us it is fated<br />
That that great hero should fall by me.<br />
In feats of activity as is wont to me.”</p>
<p>We went then into the fortress.<br />
To us came the youthful queeui<br />
Equal in splendor was she to the sun.<br />
And she bade us a hundred welcomes.</p>
<p>O. There was apparel of yellow silk<br />
On the queen of excelling beauty,<br />
Her chalk-white skin was like the swan on the wave,<br />
And her cheeks were of the colour of the rose.</p>
<p>Her hair was of a golden hue.<br />
Her blue eyes clear and cloudless ;<br />
Her honey lips of the colour of the berries,<br />
And her slender brows of loveliest form.</p>
<p>Then we there sat down,<br />
Each of us on a chair of gold,<br />
There was laid out for us abundance of food<br />
And drinking-horns filled with beoir [<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Although</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">word</span> <span class="pre">resemble</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">word</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span> <span class="pre">beer,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">liquors</span> <span class="pre">were</span> <span class="pre">very</span> <span class="pre">different]</span></code>.</p>
<p>When we had taken a sufficiency of food,<br />
And much sweet drinking wines,<br />
Then spoke the mild young princess.<br />
And thus said she, ” harken to me awhile.”</p>
<p>She told us the knowledge and cause of her tale.<br />
And the tears flowed down her cheeks ;<br />
She said, ” my return is not to my own country.<br />
Whilst the great giant shall be alive.”</p>
<p>” Be silent, O young princess !<br />
Give o’er thy grief and do not mourn,<br />
And I give to thee my hand<br />
That the giant of slaughter shall fall by me !”</p>
<p>” There’s not a champion now to be found<br />
Of greatest repute under the sun,<br />
To give battle hand to hand<br />
To the bold giant of the bard blows.”</p>
<p>O. ” I tell to thee, O gentle queen,<br />
I am not daunted at his coming to meet me.<br />
Unless he fall by me, by the strength of my arms,<br />
I will fall myself in thy defence.”</p>
<p>‘Twas not long till we saw approaching<br />
The powerful giant that was most disgusting,<br />
A load was on him of the skins of deer,<br />
And an iron bar in his hand.</p>
<p>He did not salute or bow to us,<br />
But looked into the countenance of the young maiden,<br />
Proclaimed battle and great conflict,<br />
And I went myself to meet him.</p>
<p>During three nights and three days<br />
We were in the great contest,<br />
Though powerful was he, the valiant giant,<br />
I beheaded him without delay.</p>
<p>When the two young maidens saw<br />
The great giant, lying motionless, weak and low,<br />
They uttered three joyfiil cries,<br />
With great boasting and merriment.</p>
<p>We then went to the fortress.<br />
And I was bruised, weak and feeble,<br />
Shedding blood in great abundance.<br />
Coming closely out of my wounds.</p>
<p>The daughter of the ” King of the Living” came<br />
In truth to relieve myself;<br />
She put balm and balsam, in my wounds,<br />
And I was whole after her.</p>
<p>O. We consumed our feast with pleasure,<br />
And then we were merry after,<br />
In the fortress were prepared for us,<br />
Warm beds of the down of birds.</p>
<p>We buried the great man<br />
In a deep sod-grave, wide and clear,<br />
I raised his flag and monument,<br />
And I wrote his name in Ogham Craobh.</p>
<p>On the morrow, at the appearance of day.<br />
We awoke out of our slumbers,<br />
” It is time for us,” said the daughter of the king,<br />
” To go without delay to our own land.”</p>
<p>We prepared ourselves without a stay.<br />
And we took our leave of the virgin.<br />
We were sorrowful and sad after her.<br />
And not less after us was the refulgent maid.</p>
<p>I do not know, O mild Patrick !<br />
What occurred to the young princess.<br />
Since the day we both parted her.<br />
Or whether she herself returned to the Land of Life.</p>
<p>P. Thou didst not tell us, O pleasant Oisin,<br />
What country it is in which thou wast thyself;<br />
Reveal to us now its name.<br />
And continue again the track of thy story.</p>
<p>O. That country is the ” Land of Virtues,”<br />
And certainly the name is not miscalled,<br />
If heaven hath glories as were there,<br />
To God, with love, I would give praise.</p>
<p>O. We turned our backs on the fortress,<br />
And our horse under us in full speed.<br />
And swifter was the white steed.<br />
Than March wind on the mountain summit.</p>
<p>Ere long the sky darkened,<br />
And the wind arose in every point.<br />
The great sea lit up strongly,<br />
And sight of the sun was not to be found !</p>
<p>We gazed awhile on the clouds,<br />
And on the stars that were under gloom<br />
The tempest abated and the wind,<br />
And Phoebus brightened o’er our heads.</p>
<p>We beheld by our side,<br />
A most delightful country under full bloom,<br />
And plains, beautiful, smooth and fine,<br />
And a royal fortress of surpassing beauty.</p>
<p>Not a colour that eye has beheld<br />
Of rich blue, green, and white,<br />
Of purple, crimson, and of yellow.<br />
But was in this royal mansion that I am describing.</p>
<p>There were at the other side of the fortress,<br />
Radiant summer-houses and palaces,<br />
Made, all of precious stones,<br />
By the hands of skilful men and great artists.</p>
<p>Ere long we saw approaching<br />
From the fortress to meet us.<br />
Three fifties of champions of best agility,<br />
Appearance, fame and of highest repute.</p>
<p>O. ” What beauteous country is that<br />
O gentle daughter of the golden locks !<br />
Of best aspect that the eye has seen,<br />
Or is it the ‘ Land of Youth ? “</p>
<p>” It is, truly, O generous Oisin !<br />
I have not told a lie to you concerning it,<br />
There is nothing I promised thyself<br />
But is manifest to thee for ever.”</p>
<p>To us, came after that<br />
A hundred maids of exquisite beauty.<br />
Under garments of silk filled with gold,<br />
Welcoming me to their own country.</p>
<p>We saw again approaching,<br />
A multitude of glittering bright host,<br />
And a noble great and powerful king,<br />
Of matchless grace, form and countenance.</p>
<p>There was a yellow shirt of silken satin<br />
And a bright golden garment over it.<br />
There was a sparkling crown of gold.<br />
Radiant and shining upon his head.</p>
<p>We saw coming after him<br />
The young queen of highest repute;<br />
And fifty virgins sweet and mild,<br />
Of most beautiftil form in her company.</p>
<p>When all arrived in one spot.<br />
Then courteously spoke the ” King of Youth,”<br />
And said, ” This is Oisin the son of Fionn,<br />
The gentle consort of ‘ Golden-headed Niamh !’ “</p>
<p>O. He took me then by the hand,<br />
And said, [aloud to the hearing of] the host,<br />
” O, brave Oisin ! O, son of the king !<br />
A hundred thousand welcomes to you !”</p>
<p>” This country into which thou comest,<br />
I’ll not conceal its tidings from you, in truth,<br />
Long and durable is your life.<br />
And thou thyself shalt be ever young.”</p>
<p>There’s not a delight on which the heart hath mused<br />
But is in this land awaiting thee ;<br />
O ! Oisin believe me in truth,<br />
For I am king of the ‘ Land of Youth !’</p>
<p>” This is the gentle Queen,<br />
And my own daughter the Golden-headed Niamh,<br />
Who went over the smooth seas for thee<br />
To be her consort for ever.”</p>
<p>I gave thanks to the King,<br />
And I bowed down to the gentle Queen,<br />
Nor staid we there, [but proceeded] soon,<br />
Till we reached the royal mansion of the ” King of Youth.”</p>
<p>There came the nobles of the fine fortress.<br />
Both men and women to meet us ;<br />
There was a feast and banquet continuously there.<br />
For ten nighta and ten days.</p>
<p>I espoused ” Golden-headed Niamh,”<br />
O ! Patrick from Rome of white croziers !<br />
That is how I went to the ” Land of Youth,”<br />
Tho’ woeful and grievous to me to relate.</p>
<p>P. Continue for us further thy tale,<br />
O golden Oisin of the slaying arms !<br />
How didst thou leave the ” Land of youth,”<br />
I, yet, think it long till you reveal the cause.</p>
<p>Tell to us now with great pleasure,<br />
Hadst thou any children by Niamh,<br />
Or how long wert thou in the ” Land of Youth,’<br />
Relate to us, without grief, thy story,</p>
<p>O. I had by Golden-headed Niamh,<br />
Of children of surpassing beauty and bloom.<br />
Of best form, shape, and countenance.<br />
Two young sons and a gentle daughter.</p>
<p>I spent a time protracted in length,<br />
Three hundred years and more,<br />
Until I thought ‘twould be my desire<br />
To see Fionn and the Fianna alive.</p>
<p>P. pleasant Oisin continue thy story.<br />
And tell us where are thy children ;<br />
Give us, without delay, their names.<br />
And the land in which they are.</p>
<p>O. Niamh had awaiting them.<br />
The Land of Youth— the Land of Life, and the land of Virtues :<br />
A wreath and crown of the kingly gold.<br />
And many jewels I do not mention.</p>
<p>Niamh gave to my two sons<br />
The names of my father and of my good son,<br />
Noble Fionn — head of the hosts —<br />
And Osgar of the red golden arms.</p>
<p>O. I, myself, gave to my gentle daughter,<br />
By consent of golden-headed Niamh,<br />
In virtue of her beauty and loving countenance.<br />
The true name — Plur-na-mban [the flower of<br />
women.]</p>
<p>I asked leave of the king,<br />
And of my kind spouse — golden-headed Niamh,<br />
To go to Erinn back again,<br />
To see Fionn and his great host.</p>
<p>” Thou wilt get leave from me,’ said the gentle daughter,<br />
” Though ‘tis a sorrowftil tale to me to hear you mention it,<br />
Lest thou mayest not come again in your life<br />
To my own land, victorious Oisin !”</p>
<p>” What do we dread, blooming Queen !<br />
Whilst the white steed is at my service,<br />
He’ll teach me the way with ease,<br />
And will return safe back to thyself.”</p>
<p>” Remember Oisin ! what I am saying,<br />
If thou layest feot on level ground,<br />
Thou shalt not come again for ever<br />
To this fine land in which I am myself.</p>
<p>” I say to thee again without guile,<br />
If thou alightest once off the white steed.<br />
Thou wilt never more come to the ‘ Land of Youth,’<br />
golden Oisin of the warlike arms !</p>
<p>” I say to thee for the third time,<br />
If thou alightest off the steed thyself.<br />
That thou wilt be an old man, withered, and blind.<br />
Without activity, without pleasure, without run,<br />
without leap.</p>
<p>O. ” ‘Tis a woe to me, loving Oisin,<br />
That thou ever goest to green Erinn ;<br />
‘Tis not now as it has been ;<br />
And thou never shalt see Fionn of the hosts.</p>
<p>” There is not now in all Erin,<br />
But a father of orders and hosts of saints ;<br />
O loving Oisin ! here is my kiss,<br />
Thou wilt never return to the ‘ Land of Youth !’ “</p>
<p>I looked up into her countenance with compassion,<br />
And streams of tears ran from my eyes,<br />
O Patrick ! thou wouldst have pitied her<br />
Tearing the hair off the golden head.</p>
<p>She put me under strict injunctions<br />
To go and come without touching the lea,<br />
And said to me by virtue of their power,<br />
If I broke them that I’d never returu safe ;</p>
<p>I promised her each thing, without a lie,<br />
That I would fulfil what she said to me ;<br />
I went on the back of the white steed<br />
And bade farewell to the people of the fortress.</p>
<p>I kissed my gentle consort.<br />
And sorrowful was I in parting from her,<br />
My two sons, and my young daughter<br />
Were under grief, shedding tears.</p>
<p>I prepared myself for travelling.<br />
And I turned my back on the ” Land of Youth,”<br />
The steed ran swifUy under me,<br />
As he had done with me and ” golden-headed Niamh.”</p>
<p>O. Our story is not told in full,<br />
Of every thing that occurred to myself,<br />
Until I came again back<br />
To green Erin of the many jewels.</p>
<p>O Patrick of the orders and of the saints,<br />
I never yet told you a falsehood.<br />
There is to thee the reason of my story.<br />
And how I left the ” Land of Youth.”</p>
<p>If I myself had been, O Patrick !<br />
As I was, that self-same day,<br />
I would put thy clerics all to death.<br />
And a head on a neck would not be after me.</p>
<p>If I got plenty of the bread<br />
As I used to get, at all times, from Fionn,<br />
I would pray to the king of grace<br />
To have thee safe, over it.</p>
<p>P. Thou wilt get bread and drink,<br />
Without any fault now from myself,<br />
Melodious to me is the voice of thy mouth,<br />
And continue for us still thy story.</p>
<p>O. On my coming, then, into the country,<br />
I looked closely in every direction,<br />
I thought then in truth<br />
That the tidings of Fionn were not to be found.</p>
<p>Twas not long for me nor tedious,<br />
Till I saw from the west approaching me,<br />
A great troop of mounted men and women,<br />
And they came into my own presence.</p>
<p>O. They saluted me kindly and courteously,<br />
And surprise seized every one of them,<br />
On seeing the bulk of my own person,<br />
My form, my appearance, and my countenance.</p>
<p>I myself asked then of them,<br />
Did they hear if Fionn was alive,<br />
Or did any one else of the Fianna live,<br />
Or what disaster had swept them away ?</p>
<p>” We have heard tell of Fionn,<br />
For strength, for activity, and for prowess,<br />
That there never was an equal for him<br />
In person, in character, and in mien.</p>
<p>There is many a book written down,<br />
By the melodious sweet sages of the Gaels,<br />
Which we in truth, are unable to relate to thee.<br />
Of the deeds of Fioim and of the Fianna.”</p>
<p>We heard that Fionn had<br />
A son of brightest beauty and form,<br />
That there came a young maiden for him<br />
And that he went with her to the ” Land of Youth.”</p>
<p>When I myself heard that announcement,<br />
That Fionn did not live or any of the Fianna,<br />
I was seized with weariness and great sorrow,<br />
And I was full of melancholy after them !</p>
<p>I did not stop on my course,<br />
Quick and smart without any delay,<br />
Till I set my face straightforward<br />
To Almhuin of great exploits in broad Leinster.</p>
<p>O. Great was my surprise there,<br />
That I did not not see the court of Fionn of the hosts ;<br />
There was not in its place in truth<br />
But weeds, chick-weeds, and nettles.</p>
<p>Alas, Patrick ! and alas, my grief !<br />
A miserable journey it was to me,<br />
Without the tidings of Fionn or the Fianna ;<br />
It left me through life under pain.</p>
<p>P. O Oisin ! now desist from thy grief,<br />
Shed thy tears to the God of Grace,<br />
Fionn and the Fianna are weak enough,<br />
And relief is not theirs for ever.</p>
<p>O. That would be a great pity, O Patrick !<br />
That Fionn should be in pain, for ever ; .<br />
Or what pursuers gained victory over him.<br />
Since many a hardy hero fell by himself.</p>
<p>P. It is God who gained victory over Fionn,<br />
And not the strength of enemy or strong hand,<br />
And over all the Fianna like him,<br />
Condemned to hell, they are eternally tormented.</p>
<p>O, Patrick ! direct me into the place<br />
In which Fionn is in hands and the Fianna,<br />
And there is not a hell or a heaven there<br />
That will put them under subjection.</p>
<p>If Osgar my own son be there.<br />
The hero that was bravest in heavy conflict,<br />
There is not created in hell, or in the Heaven of God<br />
A host tho’ great, that he would not destroy.</p>
<p>P. Let us leave off our coatroversy on each side<br />
And continue thy story, O valiant Oisin !<br />
What occurred to thee after that,<br />
Subsequently to the Fianna being low.</p>
<p>O. I, myself will tell thee that, O Patrick !—<br />
After I left Almhuin of Leinster,<br />
There was not a residence where the Fianna had been,<br />
But I searched accurately without any delay.</p>
<p>On my passing thro’ the glen of the thrushes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[the</span> <span class="pre">valiey</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">thrush,</span> <span class="pre">now</span> <span class="pre">anglicized</span> <span class="pre">Glenasmole.]</span></code>,<br />
I saw a great assembly there,<br />
Three hundred men and more<br />
Were before me in the glen.</p>
<p>One of the assembly spoke,<br />
And he said with a loud voice :<br />
” Come to our relief, kingly champion ;<br />
And deliver us from difficulty !”</p>
<p>I, then came forward.<br />
And the host had a large flag of marble,<br />
The weight of the flag was down on them.<br />
And to uphold it, they were unable !</p>
<p>Those that were under the flag below,<br />
Were being oppressed, weakly.<br />
By the weight of the great load<br />
Many of them lost their senses.</p>
<p>One of the stewards spoke<br />
And said : — ” O princely young hero !<br />
Forthwith relieve my host,<br />
Or not one of them will be alive.”</p>
<p>O. ‘Tis a shameful deed, that it should now be said,<br />
And the number of men that is there,<br />
That the strength of the host is unable<br />
To lift the flag with great power.</p>
<p>If Oscur the son of Oisin lived,<br />
He would take this flag in his right hand,<br />
He would fling it in a throw over the host—<br />
It is not my custom to speak falsehood.</p>
<p>I lay upon my right breast,<br />
And I took the flag in my hand,<br />
With the strength and activity of my limbs<br />
I sent it seven perches <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[1</span> <span class="pre">perch</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">16</span> <span class="pre">1/2</span> <span class="pre">feet]</span></code> from its place !</p>
<p>With the force of the very large flag,<br />
The golden girth broke on the white steed ;<br />
I came down full suddenly,<br />
On the soles of my two feet on the lea.</p>
<p>No sooner did I come down.<br />
Than the white steed took fright,<br />
He went then on his way,<br />
And I, in sorrow, both weak and feeble.</p>
<p>I lost the sight of my eyes,<br />
My form, my countenance, and my vigour,<br />
I was an old man, poor and blind,<br />
Without strength, understanding, or esteem.</p>
<p>Patrick I there is to thee my story,<br />
As it occurred to myself without a lie,<br />
My going and my adventures in certain.<br />
And my returning from the ” Land of Youth.”</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Legend of the Grey Sheep’s Cave at Coolagar-Bonroe</p>
<p>p232-3</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Since the above was written, the Honorary Secretary to the Ossianic Society has been furnished with a similar legend.</p>
<p>9, Anglesea-st., Dublin Jan. 20th, 1859.</p>
<p>Sir,<br />
There is a similar legend to that related in the following poem told of Oisin’s descent, and living for three hundred years in UAftb ija Caojiac 5lAffe (the cavern of the grey sheep), a large cave which is situated at C’oolagarronroe, Kilbenny, near Mitchelstown, in the county of Cork. After the printing of this poem had been decided upon, I wrote to Mr. William Williams of Dungarvan, who is a native of the district, for in- formation respecting any legendary lore connected with this cave, from whom I received the following answer, as being current among the peasantry.</p>
<p>J. O’D.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>LEGEND OF THE GREY SHEEP’S CAVE AT COOLAGAR-BONROE, NEAR KILBENNY.</strong></p>
<p>” Oisin went into the cave, met a beautiful damsel, after crossing the stream, lived with her for (as he fancied) a few days, wished to revisit the Fenians, obtained consent at last, on condition of not alighting from the white steed with which she furnished him, stating that it was over 300 years since he came to the cave. He proceeded till he met a carrier, whose cart, containing a bag of sand, was upset ; he asked Oisin to help him ; unable to raise the bag with one hand, he alighted, on which the steed fled, leaving him a <em>withered, decrepid, blind old man</em>.”</p>
<p>” On a certain May morning long ago, a grey sheep was seen to come out of the cave, and to go to a neighbouring farmer’s field, where she remained, until herself and her breed amounted to sixty grey sheep.</p>
<p>” The boy who took care of the sheep, was a widow’s only son, a disciple of Pan ; for he played on the bag-pipes.</p>
<p>” His master, the farmer, ordered him one fine day to kill one of the sheep, he proceeded to the field for that purpose ; but the old sheep knowing his intention, and resolving to frustrate it, bleated three times, which instantly brought all the other black sheep around her, when they disappeared altogether into the cave. The boy followed them but having crossed the <em>enchanted stream</em> which runs through the cave, he was unable to return ; as no one ever re-crosscd it but Oisin. On reflecting on the anguish his loss and absence would cause his mother, he raised a mournful strain which he accompanied by the music of his bag-pispes. On every May day from that day to this, the lamentations of the boy, and the music of his pipes are heard in the cave.”</p>

<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>pp. v-viii</p>
<p>The present lay is perhaps the most modern of the great collection of poems and romances, called ” Ossianic,” composed by various bards, who for centuries have sung the great deeds and strange adventures of Fionn and the Fianna Eireann. Perhaps not one of all these rhapsodies and legends, which form so considerable and interesting a department of Gaelic literature, is, in its present shape, or in any other, the composition of Oisin, son of Fionn. Most of the “Ossianic” poems, however, are cast in the form of a dialogue between that personage and Saint Patrick, in which Oisin relates to the saint the stirring, romantic events, “all which he saw, great part of which he was,” and by enlarging upon the supposed degeneracy of later days, magnifies the deeds of those heroes who, to him, seemed almost divine.</p>
<p>The age of any of the compositions forming this Ossianic literature cannot be exactly determined, but portions of it date back to the tenth and eleventh centuries, and some bear traces of even an earlier origin, from the days when the ancient paganism of Erin had not entirely faded from the land; but nearly all, as they have come down to us, through the course of ages, have become more or less changed from their original form, and most likely interpolated. Yet the character of the early legends, the ideas and opinions of the various actors, as shown in these truly dramatic tales and poems, have been preserved and faithfully transmitted from age to age. There is a class of Ossianic poems, which, though the work of modern bards, yet have retained so well the primitive ideas, style, and even phraseology as to be scarcely distinguishable from the modernised transcripts of ancient writings; and, by being also in the form of dialogue, imitate all the features of the original models : thus continuing the leading idea of the early poets in bringing face to face, as it were, the representatives of the Christian and Pagan systems in Ireland, in the persons of Saint Patrick and Óisin. To attain this end, and yet to avoid the anachronism of making the saint and Oisin contemporaneous, and parties to a dialogue, our bards availed themselves of the legends current in the country, detailing the circumstances and condition of the after life of the ancient heroes ; thus making Oisin, in the mysterious manner described in the present poem, sojourn for a lengthened period in the land of perpetual youth and happiness, and bringing him back from thence to be a witness of the ancient state of his country when its pristine manners had become changed and forgotten. This ” Lay” is therefore the prologue as it were to all the poems of the ” Ossianic” school. Other legends are also current of ancient heroes who had departed to ” the Elysian fields,” and who were made return to help our poets out of similar difficulties. The Classic writers, Vergil and Luciau for instance, were not so scrupulous as regards bringing together personages who lived in different ages and regions.</p>
<p>The present has a great many of the characteristics of the early Ossianic poems, and is a very faithful reproduction of the style and of the ideas expressed in them, if indeed, its author has not embodied some ancient rhymes, now perhaps lost, except the portions in this work. This poem of ” Oisin, in the land of perpetual youth,” to the authorship or date of which we have no record, is, in its present form, considered by some authorities to be the work of Michael Comyn, a poet of the county Clare, and author of several Irish poems and romances, who flourished in the early part of the last century. The legend at any rate is very familiar and popular among the Irish speaking people of his native district, many of whom can repeat considerable portions of this favourite poem. It has also been long known in the Highlands of Scotland. It has been several times published and frequently translated into English, both in metre and in prose ; but the present is the first attempt made to suit the work to the use of schools, by giving a translation exactly literal rather than elegant, yet at the same time not unreadable, and by annexing a copious vocabulary, as was done in the three lesson books issued by the society, yet of necessity more exhaustive in the present instance. Few notes have been given, but the information which would be contained in notes is embodied in the vocabulary ” under each word requiring explanation. The genitive and plural of nouns, comparative of adjectives, and infinitive of verbs have also been given under each root word, with the addition of any other inflected forms which happened to occur in the text.</p>

<p>Before providing the translation, Comyn briefly summarises the key narrative points, along with the corresponding vers number:</p>

<p>poem p24-40</p>
<p>LAY OF OISIN ON THE LAND OF THE YOUNG, AS HE NARRATED IT TO HOLY PATRICK.</p>
<p>1. P.— O noble Oisin ! O son of the king !<br />
The best in exploit, prowess, and strife,<br />
Narrate to us now without grief<br />
How thou didst survive after the Fiann.</p>
<p>2. O.— I shall tell that [to] thee, O new (-come) Patrick !<br />
Though sad (it seems) to me, its mentioning aloud.<br />
After the severe battle of Gabhra,<br />
In which was slain, alas ! the valiant Oscar.</p>
<p>3. A day of (those on) which we were all (met), the Fiann,<br />
Generous Fionn and those who lived of us (were) there.<br />
Though it was sad and melancholy our story,<br />
After our heroes being weak (<em>slaiin</em>).</p>
<p>4. In chase by us (<em>we being in chase</em>) (on) a misty morning.<br />
At the border-shores of Loch Lein,<br />
Where (there) were fragrant trees most sweet (of) blossom,<br />
And music every time melodiously at birds, (<em>birds were always singing melodiously.</em>)</p>
<p>5. The hornless deer was awakened by us,<br />
(Which) was the best (in) spring, course and nimbleness ;<br />
Our hounds and our hunting-dogs were all (together)<br />
Close in her wake in full chase.</p>
<p>6. ‘Twas not long till we saw from the west<br />
The hasty (hard) rider coming towards us—<br />
A gentle maiden most fair of countenance,<br />
On a white slender steed most sprightly in nimbleness.</p>
<p>7. We all desisted from the chase<br />
On beholding (the) form of the queenly woman,<br />
Wonder seized Fionn and the Fiann—<br />
(Seeing) that they never beheld a woman so fair.</p>
<p>8. There was a royal crown on her head,<br />
And a brown mantle of [the] precious silk<br />
Studded with stars of red gold,<br />
Covering her shoes down to the grass.</p>
<p>9. (There) was a ring of gold hanging down<br />
From each yellow curl of her hair like gold ;<br />
Her blue eyes (were) clear without a cloud,<br />
Like a drop of dew on (the) top of the grass.</p>
<p>10. Her cheek was redder than the rose,<br />
And her complexion was fairer than (the) swan on (the) wave.<br />
More sweet yet was (the) taste of her balsam (lips)<br />
Than honey which would be mixed through red wine.</p>
<p>11. There was a wide, long, smooth garment<br />
Covering the white [steed] horse ;<br />
A carved saddle of red gold,<br />
And (she had) a bridle (with a) mouth (-bit) of gold in her right hand.</p>
<p>12. (There) were four shapely shoes under him<br />
Of [the] yellow gold of most clear brightness,<br />
A wreath of silver at (the) back of his head,<br />
And there was not in the world a steed (which) was better.</p>
<p>13. She came to the presence of Fionn,<br />
And spoke gently (and) modestly in sound,<br />
And she said, ” O king of the Fiann,<br />
It is long (and) distant now my journey.”</p>
<p>14. F.— ” Who (art thou) thyself O young queen?<br />
Most excellent (in) form, beauty, and countenance,<br />
Narrate to us (the) cause of thy story,<br />
Thine own name and thy country.”</p>
<p>15. N.— ” Niamh of (the) head of gold (<em>golden hair</em>) [it] is my name,<br />
O clever Fionn of the great hosts,<br />
Above (the) women of the world I received a calling, (esteem)<br />
I am (the) fair daughter of (the) king of the young.”</p>
<p>16. F.— Narrate to us, O clement queen.<br />
What (was the) cause (of) thy coming across the sea afar.<br />
Whether (is) it thy companion (who) went from thee,<br />
Or what (is) the trouble that is upon thyself?’</p>
<p>17. N.— ” It is not my companion who went from me<br />
And as yet I was not spoken of (<em>bethrothed</em>) with any man,<br />
O king of the Fiann of highest repute—<br />
But affection and love I gave to thy son !”</p>
<p>18. F.— ” Which [of them] of my children, O blooming virgin,<br />
(Is he) in whom thou gavest love, or yet fondness,—<br />
Conceal not on (<em>from</em>) us now (thej cause<br />
And narrate to us thy case, O woman!”</p>
<p>19. N.— ” I myself shall tell that to thee, O Fionn,<br />
To thy beautiful son, of firm arms,<br />
Magnanimous Oisin of the strong hands,<br />
(He is) the hero, I am now speaking (of).’’</p>
<p>20. F.— What (is) the cause that thou gavest love,<br />
O fair virgin of the free-flowing hair,<br />
To my own son beyond all—<br />
And the number of high princes (who are) under the sun.”</p>
<p>21. N.— Not without reason, O king of the Fiann,<br />
I came (from) afar for his sake, (<em>for him</em>)<br />
But an account to get (<em>because of an account which I had got</em>) of his prowess.<br />
The goodness of his person, and of his mind.</p>
<p>22. ” ‘Tis many a king’s son and high prince.<br />
Gave me affection and lasting love,<br />
I never consented to any man,<br />
Until I gave love to the valiant Oisin ! “</p>
<p>23. O.— By that hand upon thee, O Patrick 1<br />
Though (‘twas) not shameful to me (it seemed) as a story<br />
There was not a limb of me which was not in love,<br />
With the lovely virgin of the free-flowing hair.</p>
<p>24. I took [on] her hand in my grasp,<br />
Apd said in sweet-voiced speech,—<br />
“A true gentle welcome before thee<br />
O young queen to the (this) country.</p>
<p>25. ” ‘Tis thou (who) art the brightest and fairest (in) form,<br />
Tis thou (whom) I would prefer as a wife,<br />
‘Tis thou (art) my choice beyond (the) women of the world,<br />
O gentle star, most fair (of) countenance.”</p>
<p>26. N.— Obligations which true heroes do not suffer (tor efuse)<br />
O generous Oisin, I put before thee,—<br />
(To) come with myself now on my steed,<br />
Till we reach back to (the) Land of the young.</p>
<p>27. It is the most pleasant country to be found,<br />
Greatest (in) repute now under the sun,<br />
(There are) trees bending with fruit and blossom,<br />
And foliage growing on (the) tops (of the) branches.</p>
<p>28. “Plentiful in it are honey and wine,<br />
And all things [of what] eye hath seen,<br />
Decline shall not come on thee with (<em>during</em>) thy existence<br />
Death or decay thou shalt not see.</p>
<p>29. ” Thou wilt get feasts, play and drinking,<br />
Thou wilt get sweet music on strings,—<br />
Thou wilt get silver and gold,<br />
Thou wilt get also many jewels.</p>
<p>30. Thou wilt get a hundred swords without deceit,<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred satin garments of costly silk,<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred steeds most active in tumult,<br />
And thou wilt get a hundred with them of keen hounds.</p>
<p>31. ” Thou wilt get the royal coronet of (the) “king of the young.”<br />
Which (he) never yet gave to any one under the sun,<br />
Which will make a protection for thee by night and day,<br />
In battle, in strife, and in rough conflict.</p>
<p>32. ” Thou wilt get a fitting armour of defence.<br />
And a gold-headed sword most active for stroke,<br />
From which never escaped any one alive,<br />
Who beheld yet the sharp weapon.</p>
<p>33. ” Thou wilt get a hundred suits of mail, and shirts of satin.<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred cows; and yet a hundred calves,<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred sheep with their fleeces of gold,<br />
Thou wilt get a hundred jewels which are not in the world.</p>
<p>34. ” Thou wilt get a hundred maidens merry (and) young.<br />
Radiant, shining like the sun,<br />
Most excellent in shape, form and visage,<br />
And sweeter of mouth than (the) music of the birds.</p>
<p>35. ” Thou wilt get a hundred heroes most brave in strife.<br />
Also most active in exercises of agility ;<br />
Armed, accoutred, in thy presence,<br />
In (the) Land of the young, if thou comest with me.</p>
<p>35a. ” Thou will get everything of what I have said to thee,<br />
And happiness moreover which is not clear to me to mention<br />
Thou wilt get beauty, strength and vigour,<br />
And I myself will be with thee as wife.”</p>
<p>36. O.— Any refusal I shall not give from me.<br />
O charming queen of the ringlets of gold,—<br />
Thou art my choice beyond the women of the world,<br />
And I will go with pleasure to (the) Land of the young.”</p>
<p>37. On (the) back of the steed we went both,<br />
In front of me the virgin sat,—<br />
She said, O Oisin, let us stay easily (<em>go slowly</em>)<br />
Till we reach (the) mouth of the great sea.”</p>
<p>38. Then the steed arose in strength, (<em>went with speed</em>)<br />
The time we (had) reached to (the) border of the strand,<br />
He shook himself then for travelling,<br />
And let t hree neighs out of him aloud.</p>
<p>39. When Fionn and the Fiann saw<br />
The steed hastily in the journey ,<br />
Turning his) face on the mighty sea<br />
They let three shouts of weeping and grief.</p>
<p>40. F.— ” O Oisin,” says Fionn slowly, weakly,<br />
” It is) my [own] grief thou (to be) going from me,<br />
And without expectation with me again of thy coming,<br />
Back to me under (<em>in</em>) full victory.”</p>
<p>41. O.— His form and his beauty changed,<br />
And showers of tears dropped down,<br />
Till (they) wet his breast and his bright countenance,<br />
And (he) said, “My woe (art) thou, O Oisin, (going) from me.”</p>
<p>42. O Patrick ‘twas sorrowful (was) the story,<br />
Our separating from each other there,—<br />
(The) separation of the father with his own son<br />
‘Tis melancholy, weak and faint to be at its narrating, (<em>telling it</em>).</p>
<p>43. I kissed my father gently (and) kindly.<br />
And the same (mark of) aifection I received from him,<br />
I left safety (<em>bade farewell</em>) all to the Fiann<br />
And the tears dropped down by my cheeks.</p>
<p>44. ‘Tis many a happy day I was [myself] and Fionn,<br />
And the Fiann in our company under (<em>in</em>) full power,<br />
Playing (at) chess and drinking.<br />
And hearing music,— (we) the host (which) was valiant.</p>
<p>45. Hunting in smooth (-sloped) valleys,<br />
And our hunting-dogs of sweet mouth with us there.<br />
Another while [for us] in rough conflict<br />
Felling heroes full boldly.</p>
<p>45 a. P.— O vain Oisin, desist for a while,<br />
From (narrating) thy great bravery on (of) the Fiann,<br />
How wentst thou to (the) land of the young<br />
And continue for us without deceit [on] thy story.</p>
<p>46. O.— We gave (<em>turned</em>) our back to the land,<br />
And our face directly due-west,<br />
The smooth sea ebbed before us,<br />
And filled in its billows in our track.</p>
<p>47. We saw wonders in our travel,<br />
Cities, courts and castles,<br />
White-limed (<em>white-washed</em>) mansions and fortresses,<br />
Brilliant royal seats and palaces.</p>
<p>48. We saw also by our side<br />
A hornless deer on leap (<em>leaping</em>) nimble,<br />
And a red-eared white hunting-dog<br />
Barking boldly in [the] chase.</p>
<p>49. We also beheld without deceit, (<em>in truth</em>)<br />
A young woman on a brown [steed] horse,<br />
An apple of gold in her right hand,<br />
And she a-going on (the) top of the waves.</p>
<p>50. We saw (also) in her wake,<br />
A young rider on a white steed,<br />
Under a purple red cloak of satin<br />
And a gold-headed sword in his right hand.</p>
<p>51. Who (are) they, the pair yonder, whom I see,<br />
O gentle queen, tell to me (the) reason,—<br />
That woman most beautiful (of) countenance,<br />
And (the) sleek rider of the white steed ” ?</p>
<p>52. N.— Put not regard in what thou wilt see,<br />
O humble Oisin, (nor) in what thou sawest yet.<br />
There is [not] in them all but nothing<br />
Till we reach [to] (the) land of (the; King of the young”</p>
<p>53. O.— We saw from us afar<br />
A sunny palace (of) polished front,<br />
[Was] fairest (in) form and appearance.<br />
Of (all) which were in the world to be found.</p>
<p>54. ” What (is) the royal fortress exceeding fair,<br />
And also the loveliest [of what] eye hath seen,—<br />
In (<em>towards</em>) which we are proceeding ia its meeting (<em>approaching towards it</em>),<br />
Or who is high-prince there ? “</p>
<p>55. N.— “(The) daughter of (the) king of (the) Land of the living,<br />
Is queen yet in the fortress,<br />
(Whom) Fomhor Builleach of Dromloghach took<br />
With him by violence of arms and activity.</p>
<p>56. ” Obligations she put on the brave.<br />
Without (not) a wife to make of her for ever,<br />
Till she should find a champion or a true hero<br />
Who would stand (in) strife with him hand on (<em>to</em>) hand.”</p>
<p>57. O.— “Take success and blessing, O Niamh of (the) head of gold, (<em>golden-hair</em>)<br />
I never heard (anything) of music better<br />
Than the gentle melodious voice of thy sweet mouth,<br />
And great is the sorrow with us (<em>we feel for</em>) a woman of her condition.</p>
<p>58. ” Let us go now to her knowing (<em>to make her acquaintance</em>) to the fortress,<br />
And (it) may be possible that for us it is in destiny<br />
That mighty hero to fall by me<br />
In feats of activity as was (the) custom” (with me).</p>
<p>59. We went then to the fortress,<br />
And came unto us the young queen,<br />
It was equal (the) radiance to her and to the sun.<br />
And she put (<em>expressed</em>) a hundred welcomes before us,</p>
<p>60. There was raiment of yellow silk<br />
On the queen who was most beautiful (in) aspect,<br />
Her fair skin like (the) swan on (the) wave,<br />
And her two cheeks were [on] (<em>of</em> the) colour of the rose.</p>
<p>61. [On] the colour of [the] gold was her hair,<br />
And her clear blue eyes (were) without a cloud,<br />
Her small mouth of honey (was) [on] (the) colour of the berries,<br />
And her slender brow of chiselled mould.</p>
<p>62. We sat then down,<br />
Each one of us on a chair of gold,<br />
Was laid (down) unto us much food.<br />
And drinking-horns (which) were filled with <em>beoir</em>,</p>
<p>63. When we had taken our sufficiency of food,<br />
And many (of) sweet wines of (<em>for</em>) drinking,<br />
Spoke the gentle, young queen,<br />
‘Tis this she said, Hearken to me [for] a while.</p>
<p>64. (She) told us (the) knowledge and cause of her grief,<br />
And the tears dropped down by her cheek,<br />
(She) said that there was not a return for her to her own country,<br />
And the mighty giant to be living.</p>
<p>65. ).— “Be in thy silence (<em>silent</em>), O young queen,<br />
Cease from thy grief and be not weeping,<br />
And I give to thee my hand,<br />
The giant of slaughter that (he) shall fall by us.”</p>
<p>66. R.— (There) is not a hero now to be found<br />
Though bravest in repute under the sun,<br />
Who would give single-fight, hand on (<em>to</em>) hand,<br />
To the bold giant of the hard strokes.”</p>
<p>67. O.— ” I tell to thee, O kind queen<br />
That (it is) not fearful with me (<em>in my estimation</em>) his coming in my meeting (<em>to meet me</em>)<br />
(And) if he shall not fall from the vigour of my arms,—<br />
That I myself shall fall for thy protection.”</p>
<p>68. ‘Twas not long till we saw coming.<br />
The powerful giant (who) was greatest in hideousness<br />
A bundle (was) on him of skins of deer,<br />
And a spindle- pole of iron in his hand.</p>
<p>69. (He) saluted not and bowed not to us.<br />
But looked in the countenance of the young woman,<br />
Proclaimed battle and mighty single fight,<br />
And I went myself in his meeting, (<em>to meet him.</em>)</p>
<p>70. For (the) space (of) three nights and three days,<br />
We were in the vigorous contest,<br />
Though powerful was [he] the vaHant giant,<br />
I took off his head without delay.</p>
<p>71. When the two (of) young women saw<br />
The great giant (lying) weakly (<em>dead</em>) in (the) midst, (<em>on the ground</em>)<br />
They let (forth) three shouts of exultation<br />
With great boasting and gladness</p>
<p>72. We went then to the fortress,<br />
And I was bruised, weak (and) faint,<br />
Dropping (of) blood full freshly (<em>copiously</em>)<br />
Coming closely out of my wounds.</p>
<p>73. The daughter of (the) King of the living came<br />
Truly relieving (on) myself,<br />
(She) put balm and balsam in my wounds,<br />
And I [myself] was hale after her,</p>
<p>74. We consumed our meal pleasantly,<br />
And ‘twas merry for us (the time) then after it,<br />
(There) were prepared for us in the fortress<br />
Warm beds of (the) down of the birds.—</p>
<p>75. We [ourselves] put (<em>buried</em>) the big man<br />
In a grave sod deep, wide and level,<br />
I raised his flag-stone over his monument.<br />
And I wrote his name in Ogham-Craobh.</p>
<p>76. On the morrow on sight of day,<br />
We awoke out of our slumber,<br />
“It is time for us,” quoth (the) daughter of the king,<br />
(To) proceed without rest to our own country.”</p>
<p>77. We prepared [on] us without stay,<br />
And we took our leave with (<em>of</em>) the virgin,<br />
Sad and sorrowful were we after her,<br />
And (it) was not less so for the refulgent woman after us, (<em>she was equally so</em>).</p>
<p>78. (There is) not knowledge to me, O mild Patrick !<br />
What happened to the young queen<br />
From the day we both parted with her<br />
Or whether she (herself) returned to (the) Land of the living.</p>
<p>78a. P — Thou told’st not to us, O pleasant Oisin,<br />
What the country (was) in which thou wast thyself ;<br />
Show to us now its name—<br />
And follow again (the) course of thy story.</p>
<p>78b. O.— (The) Land of Victories (is) that country,<br />
And indeed no lie (is) the name.<br />
If there is glory in Heaven (such) as was there,<br />
To God, with good-will I would give invocation (<em>praise</em>).</p>
<p>79. We gave (<em>turned</em>) our back to the fortress,<br />
And our horse under us under (<em>in</em>) full course.<br />
And [that] it was swifter with the whiie steed, (<em>the white steed was swifter</em>)<br />
Than the wind of March on (the) ridge of a mountain.</p>
<p>80. ‘Twas not long till the sky darkened,<br />
And till wind rose in every point,<br />
The great sea shone strongly<br />
And (there) was not a sight of (the) sun to be found.</p>
<p>81. A while for us (was passed) beholding the clouds,<br />
And [on] the stars (which) were under mist,<br />
The storm abated, and the wind,<br />
And Phoebus shone over our heads.</p>
<p>82. We saw by our side,<br />
A most delightful country under (<em>in</em>) full bloom,<br />
And plains, beautiful, level (and) fine<br />
And a royal fortress (which) was exceeding fair.</p>
<p>83. (There) was not a colour of (those) which eye hath seen.<br />
Of fresh blue, of green and white,—<br />
Of purple, crimson, and of yellow.<br />
That was not in this royal mansion I am saying (<em>speaking of</em>)</p>
<p>84. There were on the other side of the fortress<br />
Radiant royal-seats and palaces ;<br />
Made all of precious stones,<br />
By the hands of sages and free (<em>clever</em>) artists.</p>
<p>85. ‘Twas not long till we saw coming unto us,<br />
Proceeding from the fortress in our meeting (<em>to meet us</em>)<br />
Three fifties of champions (who) were best (in) activity,<br />
Elegance, fame and highest (in) repute.</p>
<p>86. O.— What (is) the beautiful country [it] yonder,<br />
O meek daughter of the clusters (<em>ringlets</em>) of gold,<br />
Fairest (of) aspect of what eye hath seen<br />
Or whether (is) [it] that (the) Land of the young ?”</p>
<p>87. N.— ” It is indeed, O generous Oisin,<br />
I told not to thee a lie to its side, (<em>concerning it</em>)<br />
There is not a thing of what I promised to thyself<br />
That is not manifest to thee perpetually.”</p>
<p>88. O.— There came unto us in its wake (<em>after that</em>)<br />
A hundred young women most beautiful (in) comeliness,<br />
Under (<em>attired in</em>) garments of silk filled with gold,<br />
Welcoming [before] us to their own country.</p>
<p>89. We saw again coming<br />
A troop of a chosen bright host.<br />
And a noble, powerful, brave king<br />
Most excellent (in) grace, form, and countenance.</p>
<p>90. There was a yellow shirt of silk of satin,<br />
And a bright golden garment over its head, (<em>over it</em>)<br />
There was a sparkling crown of [the] gold,<br />
Brightly glittering on his head.—</p>
<p>91. We saw coming after him,<br />
The young queen [was] highest (in) repute,<br />
And fifty ladies sweet (and) good—<br />
Who were fairest (of) form in her company.</p>
<p>92. At (<em>on</em>) coming of them all on one spot<br />
Spoke mildly the King of the young,<br />
And said “This is Oisin son of Fionn<br />
The gentle spouse of Niamh of (the) head of gold.”</p>
<p>93. He took [on] me then by (the) hand,<br />
And said aloud for the host,—<br />
R.— ” O brave Oisin ! O son of the King !<br />
A hundred thousand welcomes before thee !</p>
<p>94. This country into which thou camest,<br />
I will not conceal (its) tidings on thee, without deceit.<br />
Long and lasting is thy life,<br />
And thou thyself shalt be ever young.</p>
<p>95. (There) is not a delight for (<em>on</em>) which the heart meditated.<br />
That is not in this country under (<em>in</em>) thy presence,<br />
O Oisin, believe from me truly.<br />
That I (am) king of (the) Land of the young—</p>
<p>96. At this (<em>here</em>) (is) the kind queen.<br />
And my own daughter Golden-headed Niamh,<br />
Who went beyond (the) smooth sea for thy sake (<em>for thee</em>)<br />
To be as a spouse to her for ever.”</p>
<p>97. O.— I gave thanks with (<em>unto</em>) the king,<br />
And I bowed down to the good queen,<br />
(It) was not stopped there, quickly with us (<em>We went our way</em> quickly )<br />
Till we reached (thej royal mansion of (the) King of the young.</p>
<p>98. (There) came (the) nobles of the fine city<br />
Both man and woman in our meeting (<em>to meet us</em>)<br />
(There) was a banquet and feast there continually<br />
During ten nights and ten days.</p>
<p>99. I was married with (<em>to</em>) Niamh of (the) head of gold,<br />
O, Patrick from Rome of the white croziers,<br />
That as (<em>is how</em>) I went to the Land of the young<br />
Though sad and sorrowful (it seems) with (<em>to</em>) me to treat (of).</p>
<p>99a. P.— Continue for us further [on] thy tale,<br />
O Oisin of gold of the arms of slaughter,<br />
How didst thou leave (the) Land of the young<br />
It is yet long (it seems) with (<em>to</em>) me till thou disclosest the cause.</p>
<p>99b. Tell to us now with great pleasure,<br />
Whether (there) were any children to thee by Niamh,<br />
Or whether long (the time) thou wast in (the) Land of the young,<br />
Narrate without sorrow to us thy story.—</p>
<p>100. O.— There were to me by Niamh (of the) head of gold,<br />
Of children (who) were excellent in grace and elegance,<br />
Best (in) form, shape and countenance,<br />
Two (of) young sons and a gentle daughter.</p>
<p>100a. P.— O pleasant Oisin follow [to] thy story,<br />
And tell [to] us where are thy children,<br />
Give [to] us, without delay, their name<br />
And the country in which they are [there].</p>
<p>101. O.— (There) was with Niamh under (<em>in</em>) their presence (<em>for them</em>),<br />
The Land of the Young, of the Living, and of the Victories,<br />
A wreath and crown of (the) kingly gold<br />
And many jewels (of) which I make not [to] mention,</p>
<p>102. Niamh gave on (<em>to</em>) my two (of) sons,<br />
(The) name of my father and of my good son<br />
Illustrious Fionn,— head of the hosts,<br />
And Osgar of gold of (the) red arms.</p>
<p>103. I myself gave to my gentle daughter,—<br />
With consent of Niamh of the golden head,<br />
From virtue of her beauty and her loving countenance,<br />
The true name,— Plur-na-mban.</p>
<p>101. I spent a period long protracted.<br />
Three hundred years and more<br />
Till I thought that it would be my desire<br />
Fionn and the Fiann to see alive.</p>
<p>105. I myself asked leave on (<em>of</em>) the king,<br />
And on (<em>of</em>) my gentle spouse, golden-headed Niamh,<br />
(To) go to Erin back again,<br />
To see Fionn and his great host.</p>
<p>106. N.— “Thou wilt get leave from me” quoth the gentle daughter<br />
“Though sad (be) the story with (<em>to</em>) me you to be to its mentioning (<em>saying it</em>)<br />
For fear that there might not (be) a coming for thee again with (<em>during</em>) thy existence, (<em>that thou mightst not be able to come</em>),<br />
To my own country. O victorious Oisin.”</p>
<p>107. O.— What is (the) fear to us, O blooming queen,<br />
And the white steed to be under my will,<br />
He will teach the knowledge (<em>way</em>) [to] me with ease,<br />
And (I) will return safe back unto thyself.”</p>
<p>108. N.— ” Remember, O Oisin ! what I am saying,<br />
If thou layest foot on level ground.<br />
That (there is) not a coming for thee [ever] again for ever,<br />
To this beautiful country in which I am [my] self.</p>
<p>109. “I say with (<em>to</em>) thee again, without deceit,<br />
If thou even descendest off the white steed.<br />
That thou wilt never (-more) come to the Land of the young<br />
O Oisin of gold of the valiant arms.</p>
<p>110. “I say with (<em>to</em>) thee for the third time<br />
If (there) is a coming off (<em>if thou comest off</em>) the steed for thyself.<br />
That thou wilt be [in thy] (a) withered, blind old man,<br />
Without nimbleness, without merriment, without speed, without (a) leap,—</p>
<p>111. ‘Tis grievous with (it seems) (<em>to</em>) me, O loving Oisin,<br />
Thou (to) go to green Erin for ever,<br />
She is not now as (she) was,<br />
And thou shalt never see Fionn of the hosts.</p>
<p>112. “There is not now in all Erin,<br />
But a father of orders and hosts of saints,<br />
O loving Oisin, this (<em>here</em>) (is) my kiss<br />
Thou shalt never return to the Land of the young.”</p>
<p>113. O. I looked up in her countenance with pity,<br />
And (there) dropped from my eyes floods of tears,<br />
O Patrick! it would have been pitiful with thee (to see her<br />
Tearing (the) hair of the head of gold (<em>golden hair</em>).</p>
<p>114. She put me under severe obligations,<br />
(To) go and come without touching [with] (the) lea (land)<br />
And said with (<em>to</em>) me by virtue of their essence,<br />
If I should break them that I would not return safe.</p>
<p>115. I promised [to] her each thing without a lie,<br />
That I would myself fulfil what she said with (<em>to</em>) me,<br />
I went on (the) back of the white steed<br />
And I left (<em>bade</em>) farewell at (<em>to</em>) (the) people of the fortress.</p>
<p>116. I kissed my gentle spouse,<br />
And ‘twas melancholy we (were) at parting with her,<br />
My two (of) sons and my young daughter,<br />
Were under (<em>in</em>) sorrow shedding tears.</p>
<p>117. I prepared [on me] for travelling,<br />
And I gave (<em>turned</em>) my back to (the) Land of the young,<br />
The steed ran swiftly under me,<br />
As (he) did (before) with me and golden-headed Niamh.</p>
<p>118. Our story is not narrated fully (<em>there is nothing related of our adventures</em>),<br />
Of everything of what occurred with (<em>to</em>) myself,<br />
Until I came again back<br />
To green Erin of the many jewels.</p>
<p>119. O Patrick, of the orders and of the saints<br />
I never told a lie to thee yet.<br />
That (<em>there</em>) (is) to thee (the) cause of my story,<br />
And as (<em>how</em>) I left the Land of the young.—</p>
<p>120. If I should be myself, O Patrick !<br />
Like (<em>as</em>) I was that day (it) self<br />
I would put thy clergy all (together) to death.<br />
And a head on a neck (there) would not be after me.</p>
<p>121. If I got sufficiency of [the] bread.<br />
As I used to get every time from Fionn,<br />
I would pray unto (the) king of [the] graces,<br />
Thee to be safe over its head (<em>master of it</em>).</p>
<p>121a. P.— Thou wilt get bread and drink<br />
Without any fault now from myself.<br />
Melodious with (<em>to</em>) myself is (the) voice of thy mouth,<br />
And follow for us still [on] thy story.</p>
<p>122. O. On coming of myself then in (to the) country<br />
I looked round in every [all] point,<br />
I thought then truly,<br />
That (there) was not an account of Fionn [to me] to be got.</p>
<p>123. ‘Twas not long for me and (‘twas) not distant,<br />
Till (I) saw from the west coming towards me<br />
A great cavalcade both men and women.<br />
And they came in (to) my own presence,</p>
<p>124. They saluted [to] me gently and mildly,<br />
And wonder seized each one of them<br />
On seeing (of the) size of my [own] person.<br />
(Of) my form, my appearance, and my countenance.</p>
<p>125. I inquired myself then of them [there]<br />
Whether they heard Fionn to be alive, (<em>if Finn was living</em>) ?<br />
Or whether lived any other of the Fiann,<br />
Or what it (was) the calamity which touched (<em>happened</em>) [to] them?</p>
<p>126. S. “We heard tell on (<em>of</em>) Fionn,<br />
For strength, for activity, and for bravery,<br />
That (there) was not ever his like [there],<br />
In person, in fame, and in mind.</p>
<p>127. “Many is (the) book written down<br />
At (<em>by</em>) sweet melodious sages (of the) Gael,<br />
Which (are) not clear with us to narrate to thee, truly,<br />
On (the) deeds of Fionn, and on the Fiann.</p>
<p>128. “We have heard that Fionn had<br />
A son (who) was radiant in elegance and mould<br />
That a young woman came for his sake,<br />
And that (he) went with her to (the) Land of the young.”</p>
<p>129. O. When I heard myself that discourse<br />
That Fionn lived not nor one of the Fiann,<br />
I took weariness and great grief.<br />
And full melancholy was I after them.</p>
<p>130. I did not stop then from the course,—<br />
Quickly and swiftly without any delay<br />
Till I gave (<em>set</em>) my face, clear, level, (<em>straight</em>)<br />
For renowned broad Almhuin of Leinsber.</p>
<p>131. Great was my wonder there,<br />
That I saw not (the) court of Fionn of the hosts,<br />
There was not in its place there, truly,<br />
But weeds, chick-weed, and nettle.</p>
<p>132. Alas, O Patrick ! and alas, my woe !<br />
‘Twas sad the visit [it] (was) at (<em>to</em>) myself<br />
Without tidings of Fionn or of the Fiann,<br />
Which left me under pain with my duration, (<em>during my life</em>)</p>
<p>133. P. O Oisin ! cease now from thy grief.<br />
Shed thy tears for (the) God of [the] graces,<br />
Fionn and the Fiann are weak enough,<br />
And there is not their relieving (<em>no helping them</em>) for ever.</p>
<p>134. O. ‘Twere great the pity [that] O Patrick,<br />
Fionn for ever to be in pain,<br />
Or what [it the] pursuing-party (which) took victory on him,<br />
And (considering) the number of hardy heroes (that) fell by himself.—</p>
<p>135. P.— It is God who gained victory on Fionn,<br />
And not strength of enemies or (of) valiant hands,<br />
And on the Fiann all like him<br />
In hell condemned to their eternal tormenting.</p>
<p>136. O.— O Patrick ! direct me in (<em>to</em>) the place<br />
In which Fionn is in hand (captive) and the Fiann,<br />
And there is not a hell or a heaven,<br />
Which would put them under subjection.</p>
<p>137. If ‘tis there that Osgar my own son, is.<br />
The hero (who) was bravest in heavy conflict,<br />
(There) was not made in hell, or in the Heaven of God,<br />
A host of what size (soever) that (he) would not overcome.</p>
<p>138. P.— Let us desist from our controversy on each side,<br />
And follow (of) thy story, O valiant Oisin !<br />
What happened to thee afterwards,<br />
After the Fiann to be (<em>were</em>) on (the) ground (<em>down</em>).</p>
<p>139. O.— I myself will tell that to thee, O Patrick !<br />
After me to leave (<em>after I had left</em>) Almhuin of Leinster,<br />
(There) was not one habitation in which the Fiann were, (at any time)<br />
That I searched not eagerly without any delay,</p>
<p>140. On my taking of me (<em>going</em>) through <em>Gleann-an-Smoil</em>,<br />
I saw a great gathering there.<br />
Three hundred men and [what was] more<br />
Were before me in the valley.</p>
<p>141. A man of the crowd spoke.<br />
And he said of (<em>with</em>) a voice, aloud,<br />
D.— ” Come to our assistance O kingly hero,<br />
And deliver us from [the] hardship.”</p>
<p>142. O.— I came then (in) to (their) presence.<br />
And (there was) a large flag of marble with the host<br />
(The) weight of the flag was down upon them,<br />
And its putting (<em>to put it</em>) off them upward was not possible with them, (<em>they were unable</em>).</p>
<p>143. The portion of them which was under the flag below,<br />
They were to their oppressing (<em>being oppressed</em>) weakly.<br />
With (the) weight of the great load,—<br />
Many of them lost their memory (<em>senses</em>).</p>
<p>144. D.— A man of the stewards spoke,<br />
And said, ” O kingly young champion^<br />
Forthwith deliver [on] my host,<br />
Or a man of them will not be alive” !</p>
<p>145. O.— ‘Tis shameful the deed now to say (<em>to be obliged to say</em>),<br />
And (considering) the number of men which is there,<br />
That it came not with (<em>was not possible for</em>) (the) strength of the host<br />
This flag (to) lift full vigorously,</p>
<p>146. If Osgar son of Oisin could live,<br />
(He) would catch [on] this flag in his right hand,<br />
(He) would put it for (<em>in</em>) a cast over the host,<br />
Not a lie is becoming for me now to say.</p>
<p>147. I lay on my right side,<br />
And I caught (hold) on the flag in my hand.<br />
By (the) strength and [by] activity of my arms<br />
I put it seven perches from its place !</p>
<p>148. Through (the) need (<em>pressure</em>) of the full (<em>very</em>) large flag,<br />
The girth of gold of the white steed broke,<br />
I came down full fastly<br />
On (the) sole of my two feet on the lea (land).</p>
<p>149. No sooner came I down,<br />
Than the white steed took fright<br />
(He) went then to depart<br />
And I under hurt (<em>disabled</em>) weakly and faint.</p>
<p>150. I lost (the) sight of my eyes.<br />
My form, my countenance, and my brightness,<br />
I was [in my] (an) old man, poor (and) bhnd,<br />
Without vigour, without memory, without regards</p>
<p>151. O Patrick, that (<em>there</em>) (is) to thee my story.<br />
As happened to myself without deceit,<br />
My going and my progress fully.<br />
And my coming back from (the) Land of the young.</p>
