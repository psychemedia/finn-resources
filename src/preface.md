# Preface

If you ever listen to a professional storyteller, amongst the "standalone" 
stories they will often tell, you are also likely to come across tales 
that are part of a cycle, or that situated in a particular mythological or 
legendary context (a coherent and self-consistent "universe", in other 
words). You know you're in such a world when the storyteller suggests that 
"there are many other tales I could you about X, but they will have to 
wait for another day...".

The Fenian Cycle, tales told of Fionn MacCumhaill (aka Finn Macool), is 
one such cycle. As a novice storyteller, it has provided me with a doorway 
into the first set of connected tales that I have tried to tell from. This 
set of storynotes will document my journey through the tales, but with a 
couple of caveats: first, and most importantly, this is a "living" book, 
one that I will keep adding to, and whose structure may change over time;
secondly, though the sections will appear in a linear form, the order in 
which I originally came to each of them may have been very 
different.

To try to preserve some sense of he historical path I followed, 
I will also attempt to keep a record of the order in which I have first 
told each of the tales.
