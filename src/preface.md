# Preface

If you ever listen to a professional storyteller, amongst the "standalone" stories they will often tell, you are also likely to come across tales that are part of a cycle, or that are situated in a particular mythological or legendary context (a coherent and self-consistent "universe", in other  words). You know you're in such a world when the storyteller suggests that _"there are many other tales I could you about X, but they will have to wait for another day..."_.

The Fenian Cycle, tales told of Fionn MacCumhaill (aka Finn Macool), is one such cycle. As a novice storyteller, it has provided me with a doorway into the first set of connected tales that I have tried to tell from. This set of storynotes will document my journey through the tales. The collection will be a living one, subject to change at any point, which means that the order in which the sections appear in the table of contents may not be the order in which I created them or in which I came across the stories and my understanding of the connections between them.

To try to preserve a further sense of the historical path I followed (which is also to say, the path I am still creating), I will  attempt to keep a record of the order in which I first told each of the tales, as well as notes on how I attempted to integrate them into, or make sense of them in the context of, my developing understanding of the world of the Fianna.
