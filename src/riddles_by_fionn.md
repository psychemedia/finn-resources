"The following traditions are connected chiefly with the "House of Craignish" (Tigh Chreiginnis). This house was one of the oldest branches of the House of Lochow, which afterwards become that of Argyll."

"... owing to a variety of causes, including the change in the tastes and habits of the present generation, traditions and tales of all sorts are no longer told, and are consequently forgotten. The following are only a very few remembered out of the many current in the parish upwards of forty years ago."

"A knife," said the maiden.

Note.— Compare Campbell, Popular Tales, vol. iii, pp. 36-37. There are instructive variations between the two versions. Nos. 3 and 10 are not in Campbell. In No. 4 the question in Campbell runs: "What is redder than blood?" whilst Campbell gives as the answer to "What is hotter than fire?" .. On the other hand, Campbell gives: "A woman's thought between two men," as the answer to our No. 5. I am inclined to think this is more correct than our version ["A woman's reasoning betwixt two men"]. See the tale of Michael Scott, and my note, supra, pp. 52-3. Our No. 9 runs thus in Campbell: "What deed is the best of deeds? — A high deed and low conceit," which may be more morale but is not as delightfully characteristic of the Highland temperament as our version. Campbell has about half as many riddles again as our version, but only one is of great interest: "What is it will not bide lock and chain? — The eye of a man about his friend; it will not brook shutting or holding, but looking on him." In Campbell the maiden is Graine, Finn's wife, and Mr. Hector MacLean cites the tradition that he married her, as she was the only woman who could answer all his questions.

FIONN'S QUESTIONS.
From Donald MacPhie (smith), Breubhaig, Barra, 1860.

"Fionn would not marry any lady but one who could answer all his questions, and it appears that this was rather difficult to find. Graidhne, daughter of the King of the fifth of Ullin, answered them all, and proved herself the wisest as well as the handsomest of women. Fionn married Graidhne because she answered the questions. The reciter told me that there were a great many more, but that these were all that he could remember at the time."

H[ector] MacLean, October 20, 1860.

Fionn. What is more plenteous than the grass?
Graidhne. The dew; there will be many drops of it on one grass blade.

What is swifter than the wind?
A woman's thought betwixt two men.

What is blacker than the raven?
There is death.

What is whiter than the snow?
There is the truth.

What is a ship for every cargo?
A smith's tongs; it will hold hot and cold.

What is it will not bide lock or chain?
The eye of a man about his friend; it will not brook shutting or holding, but looking on him.

What is redder than blood?
The face of a worthy man when strangers might come the way, and no meat by him to give to them.

What is sharper than a sword?
The reproach of a foe.

What is the best of food?
Milk; many a change comes out of it; butter and cheese are made of it, and it will feed a little child and an old man.

What is the worst of meat '?
Lean flesh.

What is the best jewel?
A knife.

What is more brittle than the sow thistle?
The words of a boar pig.

What is softer than down?
The palm on the cheek.

What deed is the best of deeds?
A high deed and low conceit.

From this then it appears that Graidlme represents quick wit and beauty, and her name seems to mean Grádh — love.

Fionn always represents wisdom.

Mature wisdom marries young love, and in the stories which follow, love runs away with young valour.


[But as Fionn is due to marry Grainne, Diarmuid intervenes? Also, Innes, S.  (2016) [Fionn and Ailbhe's riddles between Ireland and Scotland](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/116223/). In: Boyd, M. (ed.)

Courting Ailbe.

1. It is called a feud between Cormac iia Cuinn and Find ua Baiscni. The reason for the quarrel was that Grainne had thrown her hatred at Find, and Diarmaid and others had given her love to Duibne. As a result, Find had been expelled and the Fiana separated from him. For these were King Cormac's foot soldiers and servants. 'Fiana' they were called because they were the king's warriors (fenidi) and soldiers. Now Finn was a matter of concern to the men of Ireland, and it distressed them that he was abroad. For every son of an Irishman who was in the service of Cormac, Find used to pay him in return to mock Cormac (?). Also, every Irishman who lived by Cormac (banished) from privateering—they used to stay at Find's house till they were reconciled to Cormac. For Cormac himself, too, Find was a matter of concern; for he had been commander of the infantry of Art the father of Cormac.

2. So peace was made with Find, and the Fuls-troops, and the household servants, and the dog-boys, and the management of the hunt restored to him, and Grainne was divorced from him by treaty. Cormac now gave his daughters the blessing if there was a girl among them who would choose to share camp with Find. `[This is a bit strange, since later (§ 8) the king advises Ailbe not to go to Find. But it's hardly even thought to use 'curse' for at night. Maybe he just doesn't want to give him his youngest, dearest daughter]` At that time, in Temair, Cormac had a daughter whose name was Ailbe Gruadbrec ('with the speckled cheek'). At that time in Temair was a druid, Citruad ('the red sheep) mac Fercaethod. All the daughters of Cormac used to come to him to ask what was in store for them. He told them all but the last daughter, Ailbe Gruadbrec. She once came to ask him which of the men of Ireland she would go to (i.e. which one she would get as a husband).

3. Then the girl said: 'I ask you, dear Citruad, what is in store for me?' etc. `[I don't understand enough of this retoric to translate it.]`

4. 'There shall come' said the druid 'to the meadow of Temair tomorrow before this hour the husband to whom thou shalt go.' — 'What kind of man is that, and what is his shape and what is his age and whence is his sex?' — 'Bring me a glass vessel with the froth of real beer in it, and I will say a sleep verse for you in it, and the color and the kind and the looks of the man you will go to will be seen (by you). And tomorrow before sunrise you shall come and tell me.' Then, after drinking the drink, she became the apparition. And she went, early in the morning before sunrise, with what she had seen, and told the druid.

5. And on the basis of the words she spoke, the poet formed the song:
1. I saw a hero with a wealth of feats of arms: welcome to me before all is the mighty, royal hero! A special brightness of flames irradiated (actually: sprinkled) us, crimson light filled us.
2. He had thrown on the folds of a red cloak, in which he dwells on the slope with the Hag of Fiana. Magnificent 1) (shine) over his pure shoulder gold, glowing with carbuncles.
3. Two men on his right with exalted sayings, white as the swan or the cotton-grass, poured out about a man as black as a raven or (like one) on which the dung-beetle is poured.
4. Two men are on his left, black as charcoal, around a warrior, who is now like a young Sprols, to whom many bracelets (?) are given.
5. To his right are worthy four, as red as a druimnln ('little rib'?) of red-gold, by two dark-brown—a dear gift—; that is an entourage of excellent people.
6. Three fours to the left hand at the front of the . . Area: four brown, four dark, four shaped like red fire.
7. Three squads are then there - that belongs to the excellent treasures -; Twenty-three, who are not fools, fill every gang,
8. A company from the sons of mighty kings - equally young is every band of them -; a band of the sons of great briuga^s; fifty boys with light curly hair.i)
9. Young men under crimson helmets sing to them from the tops of seven gas (' flutes '??) young men; 2) ... in estuaries.
10 3) of the birds on the swaying rods drier
Root; dark blackbirds play for them next to the beautiful, soft tune of the 'Men of Epheus'.*)
11. So suis is the mead in clearer vessels, served at Tailtiu's feasts: I would — a word^) with splendor — exchange some (of it) for roast wild boar.
12. In Temair may I have a litter of pure down under my two sides: I would lay birch leaves against my skin 6) under the crown of a brown-fruited oak.
13. Even if crooked harps sound, whistles, hollow-throated horns: I would rather listen to the louder flock of birds singing their praises.
14. As mighty, mighty as the smooth racehorses of Cormac son of Arts rush across the Bregia field, they are not equal to the beautiful" beasts (the game) about Cenn Drommo over the Boyne,
15. When the^) fine, slender 2) flock is around the white stripes of the chess sets, it is taken for the Bregia field with its splendor among the clusters of blossoms and buttercups. 3)
16. What I have seen whole, in my body—if my father Cormac would have liked it, I would give up the castle where I grew up for the treasures I have seen.
6. Once the feast of Temair was held by Cormac for the multitudes of all Ireland. To this revelry came Kings and Tronbers alike, Briugas and Ollams and Fian-members and Buccaneers and Brawlers and Gamers and the 'People of Art' from all Ireland, and their noble children, great and small. Seven years was the habit of preparing for the celebration of the great feast of Temair, when the men from all Ireland came to carouse. And a year was prepared for kings and nobles. They feasted for seven days and seven nights. No king came to this mine without a queen, no elegant man without an elegant woman, no fian member without a warrior woman 4), no peacemaker s) without a lover, also no Briuga without a companion, no youth without a lover, no maiden without a lover, no person without art . There the kings and the ollams arrayed themselves round the king of Temair, Cormac macAirt; viz., the kings and the ollams together, the fiana and the privateers separately, the young men and the damsels, and the stupid brute crowd by the gates. And each of them was given his due portion, namely fine tree fruit and oxen and boar and salted pigs to the kings, to the ollams and to the rest full-fledged noble elders of the Irish; Housekeepers cut up for them and served them. Old meat then from iron spears, real malt brew and fresh and old beer for the fiana and privateers; Fools and drinkers cut up for them and poured out for them. There was also meat from calves and lambs and piglets and a seventh part of the servings besides the mead for the young men and women; for their chatter entertained them . . .; male and female hired people cut up for them and served them.
7. The men of Ireland came from every direction to the feast of Temair. Also Find with the Fiana came to the citadel of Temair, and they raised* the war-song against the shafts of their spears. And among the musical tunes of Ireland there was neither melody nor song more melodious. At that time the maiden was in a chamber (small house) apart, handling the helmet of Cormac, her father, with golden needles. And it was the custom of Cormac, when the affairs of the men of Ireland set him free(?), he always went out i) to see the maiden, because of his great love for her, and because of the skill of her hands for him . For there was not a girl at that time equal to her 2) in dealing with gold and silver, and in intelligence, beauty, and sex, in prudence, eloquence, and poetry. But on hearing the fian, the mind of the maiden was so taken that what her hands did was wrong and wrong. Cormac noted the maiden's inability to use her hands. He instructed her.
8. Of this the poet sang:
L (Cormac:) 'What confuses you, daughter? What is this upset of your mind? Don't let the reputation of the fiana before Temair cloud your strong memory.'
2. (Ailbe:) 'The song of a gray man I loved to hear, a cry of triumph, cheering for (poet's) sayings. After winning fine races he has defeated your assemblies.'
3. (Cormac:) 'If you young women all want to hear it: you don't have to listen to greys. Even if they perform a real bass song, their debts do not collect them. i)
4. A gray man with a little remnant 2) of lifetime, he has a thin-bodied mind. Every gathering you are at is more perfect than the warrior of the hostage (?).
5. If there, where you see a foray, the lively 3)
Horse crowd thinks you beautiful, don't *) if you too
looking for an old Rofs.
6. (Ailbe:) 'Better for locomotion is a good horse that does not romp; with him his warrior can escape: the foal, which is (still) nothing, runs, falls, breaks its bones.'
7. (Cormac:) 'I heard a marvelous thing this morning after rising early in the morning: a heifer (ran) past the bull that loved her; she went (?) quickly to the big ox.'
8. (Ailbe:) 'The ox, which expertly pulls the cart, through which the threshing floor fills up quickly: the bull is so rough over every flock, the herd does not become full of piglets.'
9. (Cormac:) 'What is right (?) for a gaily adorned ^damsel (a speckled heifer?) . . . meanwhile: to spread the camp to the horror instead of the young Sprols, that will bring you into a bad marriage.'
10. (Ailbe:) 'I because, though I have not come into a forest: better is the fruit of a whole tree. One should not love the tender cane, it will have little growth.'
11. (Cormac:) 'I heard a treaty that was not wise: that a girl should go to an old warrior. I fear nothing good from it (or: nothing great is achieved by it): a short while until^) the drought of hate.'
12. (Ailbe:) 'Therefore I love an old man, because the blow he wields is not too soft. It is not usual to have a trembling limb on his body, 2) whatever the beauty of his body.
13. Better is Temair's Wall, which has reached its old age—it is certain that its merit is a lasting one—than the fortress which was new yesterday, which was thrown up by Mac Arrtaile (?).'
14. (Cormac:) 'Does duirmel{?) send the pretty branch under the side of the oak? Because without warmth the plants wither under the fruit-rich oaks.
15. May your condition not become sorrowful like that of the bird around which the snare was closed. You can't undo it afterwards if your camp regrets you too.'
16. (Ailbe:) 'Why do you trap the bird 4) in its spotless down? I would not put my foot in a sling to await my final death.'
17. (Cormac:) 'I do not dislike negotiating at your side - ugly is a gray face for a warrior -; that will make you perfect, it will bring all the best to the daughter.'
18. (Ailbe:) 'I'm sure, even if I did it, that a gray-headed warrior would be rejected: my little father wouldn't sue me for it ^), because of going to the loud Fian.'
19. (Cormac:) 'Even if I tell you: 'Love no old man; that is what a good woman will do', so I was not in the habit of turning away valor debts ... for a good person ß).'20. ...1)
21. (Ailbe:) 'Why shouldn't you and I have a chat when it can't be a bother? If a woman's deeds can be good, what I have heard is good.'
9. Then someone came from Cormac to ask Find what art he had he would bring to Temair. 'I'm well versed in ancient sayings and the challenge of cross-talk,' said Find. — 'That's the art of tots and girls with us,' said Cormac. — 'That's how I address tots,' said Find, 'and that doesn't stop me. 2) I will bring Scenb Scuile^); whose art will be(?) to free women and girls.' — 'Come into the city,' said Cormac, 'no king without queen, no fian-member without warrior wife, no Briuga without mate, no peacemaker without lover, no youth without lover, no maiden without lover, no man without art' — 'I I have' said Find 'till now thrice fifty election placards to the daughters of rulers of Ireland and Scots, and they all made the fianae of Ireland their own, so that there is no half-crooked 4) yoke and no half-empty camp than only my own. Now if you have a fine wife who is not a false fine, give her to me.' — 'Ask yourself,' said Cormac, 'in the circle of fine women, whether there is one among them who will answer you and play the word game with you.' - Then Find himself went into the city and came to the homestead where the daughters of Cormac were in a splendid grianän (actually 'Söller'), weaving braids and embroidery threads of gold and silver on robes of all colors.
10. Then Find spoke the following 'Schnitzel of Elegance': 'Girls', said Find, 'is there anyone among you who because?
1. Which nafs is more spread out than all the seas i)?' — 'The dew is spread further 2)', said Ailbe Gruadbrec, Cormac's daughter. She answered because there was no wiser woman in the house, and also because the speech was addressed to her.
2. 'What is sweeter than mead?' said Find. — 'Familiar conversation*)' said the girl.
3. 'What is redder than blood^?' said Find. — 'The blush of noble children 6)' said the girl.

17. 'How many trees are in Assal?' said Find. — 'Two trees' said the girl, 'the green one and the dry one'.
18. 'How many horses come to Tailtiu?' said Find. — 'Two horses' said the girl, 'mare and stallion'.
19. 'What's the best gem?' said Find. — 'The knife' said the girl, 'because one compares it to the intellect'.
20. 'What is the best thing about the warrior?' said Find. — 'High deed and humble pride' said the girl.
21. 'What is the best thing in woman?' said Find. — 'Gentleness, domesticity, modesty, silence, ability to speak,' said the girl.
22. 'What is the best food?' said Find. — 'The milk' said the girl; 'well she is fresh, well she is old, well she is fat, well she is thin; she nourishes the child, she sustains the senile'.
23. 'What is the worst food?' said Find. — 'A lean skeleton, spoiled broth i)' said the girl; 'where you find it, throw it away'.
24. 'What holds neither bolt nor chain? ' said Find. — 'A pretty woman's look at her boyfriend,' said the girl.
25. 'What is the best thing about speech?' said Find. — 'Wisdom, brevity' said the girl. 2)

And if you don't like the offer, stay with your people so you don't regret it later.'

14. Thou shalt not be brought into a bad marriage, not separated from rulers; there will be no whining over gloomy days; you will have fine, excellent young people.'
18. 'This offer suits me,' said the girl, 'and to receive it from you seems better to me than a greater good from any other.' — 'Well, girl,' said Find, 'we would accept your banishment (from the court) if there were no violation of Cormac's law.' — 'You true warrior,' she said, 'what you say is not in vain. Let's roam forest after forest. Let us wear robes without purple. Let's drink beer without honey (Met C). Let's let horses jump without reins. Let's do the Tailtiu-
hold races without chariots. Let us divide the inheritance without blades, i) Let us divide (divide) the land without (presence of) tribes. 2) Let's crack nuts without teeth.^) May everyone do their campaigning without Cormac. If I found an upper millstone, I would make myself the lower millstone. We shall do the will of Cormac at home,' said the girl, 'once we have first done what pleases us.' — 'That's how we want to do it,' said Find. 'I will not turn away the King of Ireland's daughter of her own choosing. For if I turn them down too, worse courtship will result.' — Afterwards, the girl went to Find with Cormac's will, and Find paid 7 cumal as a promotional price.
14 Find wanted to instruct her and said to her:
'Don't sit in a chair, girl,' Find said, 'for you to fill it up.' — 'Don't go from the hunt either (to the hunt?)' said the girl, 'until you have distributed (determined) the game.'
'Put your hand to the handwork, girl,' said Find, 'that your dexterity may be seen.' — 'Don't linger, don't wait'*) on your bed when you get up,' said the girl.
'Against raw beings is one thing^), girl', said Find. "The other thing is out of childish love," said the girl.
'I can't raise you like that here,' Find said. — 'Nothing outstanding is a single millstone,' said the girl. 'Not to quarrel with you or to argue with you do I do this; only it is easy for you to speak if you speak alone without anyone objecting.'

1. The text is about the story of a conflict between Cormac and Find, caused by the love of Grainne for Diarmaid, which resulted in Find being exiled and separated from the Fiana. The people of Ireland were worried about Find's absence, and Cormac was also concerned about him as he had been the leader of the Fiana during the reign of Art, Cormac's father.

2. Eventually, peace was made with Find, and he was given back his troops, household, and hunting dogs. Cormac gave his blessing to any of his daughters who wanted to share a bed with Find. At this time, Cormac had a daughter named Ailbe, and she consulted with a druid named Citruad about her future husband.

3. The druid told her that her husband would come to the meadow of Temair before sunrise and that he would give her a sleep potion that would allow her to see his appearance.

4. She drank the potion and saw the appearance of her future husband, and then reported back to the druid at dawn.

5. And based on the words she spoke, the poet formed the song:

I saw a hero with a wealth of war deeds: most welcome to me is the mighty, kingly hero! Special flames shone (actually: sprinkled) upon us, purple radiance filled us.

He had thrown the folds of a red mantle around him, in which he dwelt with the Hag of the Fiana on the slope. Magnificence shines over his pure shoulder, glowing through carbuncle.

Two men to his right with sublime utterances, as if it were the swan or the cotton grass, poured over a man as black as a raven or (like one) over the dung beetle.

Two men are to his left, black as smith's coal, about a warrior who is white as a young shoot to whom many clamps (?) are given.

To his right are worthy four, as red as a druimnin ('little rib'?) of red gold, around two dark browns - a dear gift of radiance -; this is a retinue of excellent people.

Three times four to the left hand at the front of the... surface: four browns, four dark, four shaped like red fire.

Three rotes are there then - that belongs to the treasures of excellence -; twenty-three who are not foolish, they fill each rote.

A rote from the sons of powerful kings - each band of them is equally young -; a rote from the sons of great briugas; fifty boys with brightly shining hair.

Seven young men under a purple-green helmet sing to them from the tips of seven branches ('flutes'?); 2) ... in river-mouths.

The birds play to them on the swaying roots of dry
herbs; dark blackbirds play for them in the beautiful, quiet manner of the 'Men of the Ivy'.-*)

trade a little of it, with shining words, for roast wild boar.
If I could have a bed of soft feathers in Tara under both of my sides, I would like to lay birch leaves against my skin, under the crown of an oak tree with brown fruit.

Even if curved harps resound, pipes, hollow-sounding horns, I would rather listen to the clear bird-flock with their praising song.

The sleek racing horses of Cormac, the son of Art, thundering heavily over the plains of Bregia, are not equal to the beautiful creatures (the wild animals) around Cenn Dromma above the Boyne.

When the nine fine, slender bands are around the white strips of the chessboard, they are held as equal to the plains of Bregia, with its brilliance under the clusters of flowers and buttercups.

What I have seen that is sacred in my body - if my dear father Cormac would allow it - I would give the fort in which I was raised for the treasures I have seen.

`[chatgpt summary of the song: The speaker describes a heroic figure and the various people and creatures around him, as well as expressing their own desires for a comfortable bed and a preference for listening to birds over musical instruments. They also express admiration for wild animals and a preference for them over racing horses. The speaker ends by saying they would give up their childhood home for the treasures they have seen.]`

6. Once, Cormac held the feast of Tara for the crowds from all over Ireland. To this feast came kings and nobles, bards and druids, Fianna members and pirates, robbers and hunters, and the 'people of the arts' from all over Ireland, and their noble children, both small and great. For seven years, they used to prepare for the celebration of the great feast of Tara, where men from all over Ireland came to drink. And one year was prepared for kings and nobles. They feasted for seven days and seven nights. At this drinking, no king came without a queen, no elegant man without an elegant woman, no Fianna member without a warrior woman, no peaceful man without a lover, no bard without a companion, no young man without a beloved, no maiden without a lover, no person without an art. There, the kings and the Ollams (poets) gathered around the king of Tara, Cormac mac Airt; namely, the kings and Ollams together, the Fianna and pirates separately, the young men and the girls and the foolish raw people by the gates. And each of them was given their rightful share, namely, fine fruits and oxen and boars and salted pigs to the kings, Ollams, and other fully valid elder men of the Irish; housekeepers and housemaids divided for them and poured out for them. Red meat from iron spits, proper malt brew, and fresh and old beer to the Fianna and pirates; fools and drunkards divided for them and poured out for them. There was also meat from calves and lambs and pigs, and the seventh part of the servings besides the mead for the young men and girls; for their chatting entertained them... male and female servants divided for them and poured out for them.

7. The men of Ireland came from every direction to the festival at Tara. Find, with the Fiana, also came to the meadow of Tara's fortress, and they raised the war cry against the shafts of their spears. And among the music of Ireland, there was neither a melody nor a song that was more clear-sounding. At that time, the maiden was in a separate chamber, handling her father Cormac's helmet with a golden thread. It was Cormac's custom that when the affairs of the men of Ireland left him free, he always went out to see the maiden because of his great love for her and her skillful hands. For there was no girl at that time who was her equal in handling gold and silver, and in intelligence, beauty, gender, cleverness, eloquence, and poetry. But when the maiden heard the Fian, her mind was so taken that what her hands did was twisted and incorrect. Cormac noticed the maiden's inability to use her hands and instructed her.

`[chatgpt summary: The first passage describes a great feast held by Cormac mac Airt at Tara, attended by people from all over Ireland including kings, nobles, bards, druids, Fianna members, pirates, robbers, hunters, and those skilled in the arts. The feast lasted for seven days and seven nights, and each group was given their rightful share of food and drink. The second passage describes how the men of Ireland, including the Fianna, came to the festival at Tara and raised the war cry. Cormac's daughter was in a separate chamber handling his helmet when she heard the Fian and became distracted, but Cormac noticed and instructed her.]`

The poet sang of it:

Cormac said, "What troubles you, daughter? What is this upheaval of your mind? Do not let the strong memories cloud your mind with the call of the Fiana before Tara."

Ailbe replied, "I have heard the song of a gray man, a cry of triumph that spurs on (poetical) sayings. He has won your gatherings with his victory in beautiful races."

Cormac said, "If you young women want to hear it all: you should not listen to the gray ones. Even if they can perform the right lamentation, they cannot collect their debts. "

A gray man with a little time left has a shallow mind. Every assembly you attend is more perfect than the warrior of the hostage band (?).

If you see a lively herd of horses on a raid, it may seem beautiful to you, but ... *) if you also look for an old shelter.

A good horse that does not frolic is better for travel; with it, its warrior can escape. The foal, which is still nothing, runs, falls, and breaks its bones.

Cormac said, "I heard something strange this morning after getting up: a heifer ran past the bull who loved her; she quickly went to the big ox."

Ailbe replied, "The ox that expertly pulls the cart, through which the barn fills quickly, is more courageous over every flock than the bull; the herd will not be full of piglets."

Cormac said, "What is right for a young woman adorned in many colors (a speckled young cow?) ... meanwhile, spreading the bed for the gray man instead of the young suitor will bring you a bad marriage."

Ailbe replied, "I know, even if I have not gone into the woods: the fruit of a complete tree is better. One should not love the tender rod; it will have poor growth."

(Cormac:) "I heard of an agreement that was not wise: that a girl goes to an old warrior. I fear nothing good will come of it; only a brief moment until the drought of hatred."

(Ailbe:) "That is why I love an old man, because the blow he strikes is not too weak. An unsteady limb is not usual on his body, no matter how it stands with his bodily beauty."

"Better is the wall of Tara, which has reached its age—it is certain that its merit is enduring—than the fortress that was new yesterday, which was raised by Mac Artail(?)"

(Cormac:) "Does the pretty branch of the wormwood lie beneath the side of the oak? For the plants wither there without warmth, among the fruitful oaks."

"May your condition not be sorrowful like that of the bird around which the snare is wound. You cannot undo it later, even if you regret your bed."

(Ailbe:) "Why lure the bird in its spotless down into traps? I would not put my foot in a snare where I would expect my ultimate death."

(Cormac:) "I do not dislike negotiating at your side—it is becoming for a warrior to have a gray face; it will make you complete, and will bring all good things to the daughter."

(Ailbe:) "I am sure that even if I did it, refusing an old gray-haired warrior would not make my father accuse me, for going to the pure Fian."

(Cormac:) "Even if I tell you, 'Do not love an old man; that is what a good woman will do,' I used to not refuse debts of bravery... for a good person."

Then Ailbe said, 'Why shouldn't you and I have a conversation, since it can't cause any trouble? If a woman's actions can be good, then what I have heard is good.'

`[ChatGPT summary of the song: Cormac and Ailbe exchange several poetic riddles about love and marriage. Cormac advises Ailbe not to be swayed by the charms of a gray man who cannot fulfill his debts, while Ailbe argues that an old man may be a better choice because he is more reliable. They also discuss the merits of old versus new things and the importance of making wise choices in love and life. Despite their differing perspectives, they agree to have a friendly conversation without causing any trouble.]`

9. Someone from Cormac's party came to ask Find what skill he possessed that he would bring to Tara. 'I am skilled in old sayings and in the challenge of poetic composition,' said Find. 'That is the skill of children and girls among us,' said Cormac. 'So I address children,' said Find, 'and that does not deter me. I will bring Scenb Scuile, whose skill will be to woo both women and girls.' 'No king comes to the city without a queen, no member of the Fianna without a warrior woman, no brehon without a companion, no peacemaker without a sweetheart, no young man without a beloved, no maiden without a lover, no person without a skill,' said Cormac. 'I have,' said Find, 'made fifty-three offers of marriage to the daughters of rulers of Ireland and Scotland, and they all gave themselves to the Fianna of Ireland, so that there is no half-tilted yoke or half-empty bed except my own. If you have a fine woman who is not false, give her to me.' 'Ask for yourself,' said Cormac, 'among the circle of fine women, if there is one among them who will answer you and play the game of words with you.' Then Find himself went into the city and came to the courtyard where Cormac's daughters were, in a magnificent grianán (actually 'solarium'), weaving ribbons and embroidering threads of gold and silver onto garments of every color.

10. Then Find spoke the following "schnitzel of elegance": "Girls," said Find, "is there anyone among you who knows the following:
Which soul is more widespread than all the seas?" "The dew is more widespread," said Ailbe Gruadbrec, Cormac's daughter. She answered because there was no wiser woman in the house, and also because the question was directed at her.
"What is sweeter than mead?" said Find. "Intimate conversation," said the girl.
"What is redder than blood?" said Find. "The blush of noble children," said the girl.
"What is blacker than the raven?" said Find. "Death is blacker," said the girl.
"What is whiter than snow?" said Find. "Truth," said the girl.
"What is faster than the wind?" said Find. "Thought," said the girl.
"What burns hotter than fire?" said Find. "The face of the Briugaid (innkeeper) when he is told guests are coming to his house and he has nothing to offer them," said the girl.
"What is fatter than the bacon of a fattened boar?" said Find. "The love of a man from whom you have parted," said the girl.

"What is sharper than the sword?" said Find. "The mind," said the girl.

"What is more fragile than peanuts?" said Find. - "The nature (character) of a jealous woman," said the girl.
"What is lighter than a spark?" said Find. - "The mind of a woman who is torn between two (men)," said the girl.
"What is more resistant than the beach?" said Find. - "The cliff," said the girl.
"What is the herb that is cooked for everyone?" said Find. - "The blacksmith's tongs," said the girl.
"Who is the living son born of a dead woman?" said Find. - "Lighting a fire in the mouth of gainel," said the girl.
"What is more beautiful than the thimble?" said Find. - "Deceit," said the girl, "that is, to bring shame: if he wants to deceive you, he shows you his best side."
"How many trees are in Assal?" said Find. - "Two trees," said the girl, "the green one and the withered one."
"How many horses come to Tailtiu?" said Find. - "Two horses," said the girl, "mare and stallion."
"What is the best jewel?" said Find. - "The knife," said the girl, "for it resembles the intellect."
"What is the best thing about a warrior?" said Find. - "Noble deed and humble pride," said the girl.
"What is the best thing about a woman?" said Find. - "Gentleness, homemaking, chastity, silence, ability to speak," said the girl.
"What is the best food?" said Find. - "Milk," said the girl; "it is good fresh, good old, thick or thin; it nourishes the child, it sustains the elderly."
"What cannot be held by lock or chain?" said Find. - "The gaze of a pretty girl toward her boyfriend," said the girl.

"What is the best thing about speech?" said Find. - "Wisdom, brevity," said the girl.

"What is best for the eye?" said Find. - "Cold, fat, darkness," said the girl.

"What is worst for the eye?" said Find. - "Heat, irritation, hunger," said the girl.

"What is more bitter than poison?" said Find. - "The insult from an enemy," said the girl.

"What is more restless than a weasel?" said Find. - "The advice of a foolish man," said the girl.

"What is softer than down?" said Find. - "The palm on the cheek," said the girl.

"What makes one happier than drunkenness?" said Find. - "The tenderness of a woman towards a young boy," said the girl.

"What is thinner than water?" said Find. - "Smoke," said the girl.

"What is wider than the corvette(?)?" said Find. - "The sea," said the girl.]

11. "Perhaps we have exchanged enough words with the men of Tara, girl," said Find. - "If it is enough," said the girl, "you have started talking, and it is up to you to conclude." - "If you are willing to come to bed with me and sleep with me, girl," said Find, "what you will receive from me upon your arrival will be described to you immediately, and I will not deny it to you. And if you do not like the offer, stay with your people so that you will not regret it later."

12. So he spoke:

"If it is agreeable to you, you shall receive Haselmet in silver cups; on birch leaves you shall recline, even if horses and carriages are lacking.
I know well that you will not end the day without a great fire each evening; a bunch of watercress, a bunch of garlic over the ships' decks at mealtimes.
Every morning you shall receive...the game from Mag Muirtheimni, which roams the forest near the Bregia Field.
To play for you, you shall have...green pipes (pipers?); the song of the Seat(?) of the Met Procession-i), against which the Fiana...
The anvil under blows beside the cooking hearth, the branched(?) Fian plain; the roasting spit in its wheeling feats(?)5j, the leaping of the speckled fawns through the thorn hedge.
The glory of nut-gathering through swift strokes(?')); the challenge of the brown deer through the hazel copse(? ^)); the crooked-nosed, worm-skinned lairnill(?); the troop of weasels along the leafy oak.
Cranberries, tender(?) blackberries, raspberries on the branches, honeycombs, sloes on the thorn bush, blueberries, the beautiful badgers, the woodcock.
Apples, acorns, a good catch through the wavy-behind. The dark wild duck, the lower part of the orache, the bunch of primrose, dulse (edible seaweed), collected from cliffs. Stone throwing with slingshots, hunting for bird flocks, catching salmon, strawberries, eggs, buttercups, and washing gravel. Speckled jumping salmon, the slender (?) seal, the bawling striped one, the seals of the light green ocean, the flesh of the lively, bridled foal. The cushion of the green-leaved forest, sitting on watchtowers, listening to the voice of the black stream, the loud wind through the leafy oak forest. Fidcheli, speckled brandub, buanbach, as intoxicating as diadems(?), the common drink of the red-sworded friends, wisely shared by our servant. Fine living together in love (?), sports without blushing, warm intimate conversations, the foot no longer wanders after sunset.

II. You shall not be brought into a bad marriage, not be separated from rulers, there will be no lamentation over dark days; you will have excellent young people.

`[chatgpt summary: The passage describes a list of gifts and pleasures that will be provided to someone, including silver cups, birch leaves to recline on, a great fire every evening, and various types of food such as watercress and game. They will also have entertainment such as music and games, and the opportunity to participate in various outdoor activities like hunting and gathering. The second part of the passage promises that this person will not be forced into a bad marriage or separated from rulers, and that they will have good company.]`

13. "This offer suits me well," said the girl. "To receive it from you seems better to me than a greater wealth from anyone else."

"Well then, girl," said Find, "we would accept your banishment from the court if it were not a violation of Cormac's law."

"You true warrior," she said, "what you speak is not vain. Let us roam forest after forest. Let us wear garments without purple. Let us drink beer without honey (mead). Let us let horses jump without reins. Let us hold the Tailtiu race without chariots. Let us divide the inheritance without kings. Let us split the land without tribes present. Let us crack nuts without teeth."

"Let each man make his courtship without Cormac's interference. If I found the upper millstone, I would make myself the lower one. We will do Cormac's will at home," said the girl, "once we have first done what pleases us."

"So let's do it," said Find. "I will not reject the daughter of the king of Ireland according to her own choice. For if I reject her, there will be a worse courtship as a result."

Later, the girl went to Find with Cormac's approval, and Find paid seven cumals as a bride price.

14: Find wanted to instruct her and said to her: "Do not sit in a chair, girl, that you fill it completely." - "Also, don't go hunting until you have distributed (determined) the game," said the girl. "Get to work with your hands, girl," said Find, "so that your dexterity is visible." - "Do not linger, do not wait," said the girl when you get up from your bed. "That is for rough people, girl," said Find. - "The other is out of childish love," said the girl. "I cannot educate you here in this way," said Find. - "A single millstone is nothing outstanding," said the girl. "I do not do this to argue with you or to argue with you, only you can talk easily when you speak alone without anyone's opposition."

15. The girl then stayed with Find and bore him three sons. Their names are Raigne the Chosen, Uillenn Green Eyelash, and Caince the Purple. From Raigne the Chosen, whom we have mentioned, comes Raigne in the land of Ui Conaill, from Uillenn Green Eyelash comes Sliab Uillinn in Leinster, and from Caince the Purple comes Cruach Cainci (Caiuce Hill) in the territory of Connaught. After Ailbe came to him, three wonderful things happened to Find. He slept by the river Sadb, and a white-purple pustule with the brilliance of a carbuncle was placed under his breasts. His hair was also dyed yellow, so that it was as yellow as the dust of red gold over precious stones. And a cup-shaped thread net was pulled over his head from behind, so that he was as round as a ball, without the net ever being undone in his lifetime.
Therefore, the story of the wooing of Ailbe, Cormac's daughter, by Find ua Baiscni is told.

`[chatgpt summary: In this passage, the girl expresses her desire to be with Find instead of having greater wealth from anyone else, but Find cannot accept her banishment from the court due to Cormac's law. However, they eventually come to an agreement and get married. Find gives her advice on how to conduct herself and they have three sons. After Ailbe comes to him, Find undergoes three physical transformations. This story is about the wooing of Ailbe, Cormac's daughter, by Find ua Baiscni.]`
