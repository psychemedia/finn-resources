# Diarmuid and Grainne

The tale of Diarmuid and Grainne does not show Fionn in such a heroic light.

Fionn woos Grainne, the daughter of King Cormac, grandson of Conn of the Hundred Battles. In one telling, Fionn asks Grainne a series of riddles; in return, Grainne also sets Fionn a challenge (collect animals) that Cuilthe meets. Grainne sees Dermot's love spot, and you can imagine what happens next.

Eventually, Fionn concedes Grainne (?) and now woos her sister, Alva / Aibe / Ailbhe . In some tellings, it is Ailbhe who is presented with the riddles. (Or perhaps they both were?)

But the rot has set in, and Fionn's relationship with Cormac has suffered?

Tensions between Fionn and the Morna clan (eg fights, lead up to Ghabra).

Finally, Ghabra battle with Cormac's son, Cairbre, after another conflict.

FINN AND GRAINNE.

The following short tale is here published for the first time from a copy in the Book of Lecan, the only one known to me. An Irish poem on the same subject from the Hodges and Smith collection was published by the late Sir W. Wilde in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Vol. VII. pp.184. — 191, and a similar Gaelic poem is in the Book of the Dean of Lismore. pp. 42 — 49 (= Cameron's Reliquiae Celticae I, pp. 72 — 75). In these poems Cailte collects the animals, about one hundred of which are enumerated, in order to deliver Finn from the hands of Cormac.

The chief interest of our story lies in the fact that it gives a different account of Finn's wooing from that contained in the *Tóruigheacht Dhiarmuda agus Ghrainne*. From its language it can hardly be earlier than the 13th centiuy. The various speeches at the end are composed in the same poetical style which in the *Táin Bo Cualnge* is called *retoric*. I am unable to translate them, except a sentence here and there, such as: *ní théit nach n-om a coiri* 'nothing raw comes out of a caldron'.

Book of Lecau, fo. 181 a, 2. 

Translation

Finn, the descendant of Baiscne, went to woo Grainne, the daughter of Cormac, the grandson of Conn. But she said that she would not sleep with Finn, unless the bridal gift were brought to her which she would demand of him; for an impossible (?) condition she wished to demand of him, that she might not be united with him. But Finn said that he would bring what she would ask of him, whether it were near or far. Said the maiden, she would not take any other gift from him, but a couple of every wild animal that was in Ireland to be brought in one drove, until they were on the rampart of Tara, and she vowed that he and she would not unite, unless that drove were brought. 'I shall go and bring it", said Finn. 'I shall go', said Cailte the swift-footed, the son of Oisgen or Conscen, the son of the Smith of Muscraige Dobrut; a son he of Cumall's daughter. So Cailte went, and caught a couple of every wild animal, and brought the straggling drove until they were on the green of Tara. He went where Cormac was, and told him that his daughter's bridal gift was on the rampart of Tara. 'What was hardest for thee to bring?' Cormac asked. 'Not hard to tell. It took me ... to come up with the fox ', said Cailte. Then in an unlucky hour Grainne was given to Finn; for they never lived in peace until they separated. Finn was hateful in the eyes of the maiden, and such was her hatred, that she sickened of it. The feast of Tara was held by Cormac, and from every side the men of Ireland assembled for it. And they were enjoying the feast of Tara. Then the men of Ireland were around Cormac in the royal house and Finn also with his fians like everybody else. As Grainne went past Cormac, he noticed her sorry looks. 'What ails thee, woman?' asked Cormac. Then she said in a very low voice to Cormac, so that the chief should not hear it: 'Truly, my dear boy Cormac, it is but natural. There is a lump of gore beneath my heart of the size ... hatred of my husband, so that the sinews of my body are all swollen'. Then said Cormac: ' 'Tis a black pity' &c. Finn heard that and knew that he was hated by the girl, and he said this: ' ;Tis time for us to separate' &c.
