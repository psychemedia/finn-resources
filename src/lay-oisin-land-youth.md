# The Lay of Oisín in the Land of Youth

It seems likely that the tale as told by the late 19th century and early twentieth century folklorists derives from renditions of Michael Coumin's 18th century poem *The lay of Oisín in the land of youth*, though the legend is undoubtedly older.

Several out-of-copyright translations of the poem can be readily found via `archive.org`.

This first example is by Thomas Flannery, published in 1896. Flannery provides some historical context for the origins of the poem in his introduction:

> The Irish poem given in the following pages is the composition of *Micheál Coimín* — anglicè 'Comyn' or 'Cummin' — a native of the County of Clare, who was born about the year 1688, at Kilcorcoran, near Miltown-Malbay, and died in 1760. The date of the poem may be given approximately as 1750.
>
> It is called the *Laoi Oisín* partly because Oisín is the hero of the story, partly because he is represented also as the narrator — after the manner of many mediaeval and later poets who loved to grace their own compositions with the name of the ancient bard. But it does not pretend to be an ancient poem — it is just the language of one of the better educated Irish poets of Munster of the middle of the last century — however ancient the legend itself and the traditions it embodies. It is also known as *Laoi ah Choimímg* or 'Comyn's Lay'. For more than a hundred years it existed only in manuscript, copies of the story passed from hand to hand, and in this way and by oral transmission it gradually spread to the neighbouring counties of Kerry, Galway, Mayo — the western counties generally of Ireland, and even to the west of Scotland.

In introducing the poem, Flannery provides a summary of the story it relates, a tale we are now familiar with:

> The story in outline is this. Whilst Finn and his Fenians are one day hunting around Loch Lein — otherwise the Lakes of Killarney — a lady of dazzling beauty suddenly appears, mounted on a white steed, coming apparently up from the sea. She meets Finn and tells him she has come from the Land of Youth, has heard of the fame and doughty deeds of his son Oisín, she loves him, and wants him to go with her to *Tír na nÓg*. She describes the charms and joys of that lovely land, and Oisín gladly consents to go away with her. They go away and at length reach Tir na nÓg where they are wedded. After many years of blissful life, Oisín longs to see Erin once more — longs to see his father Finn and gallant friends of former days. With much weeping and pleading Oisín's wife at length consents to let him go, pledging him not to dismount from his horse, or he will never be able to return. Oisín accepts the pledge, returns to Erin, is amazed to find he has been away for three hundred years, is grieved beyond measure to learn that Finn and the Fenians are no more, and resolves to go back at once ; but in his generous attempt to help some workmen out of a difficulty, wishing at the same time perhaps to show his great strength, by a most melancholy accident he is thrown off his horse, he suddenly becomes a blind, old man — a mortal once more, fated never to return to the Land of Youth.

Flannery also reviews an additional scene included in the poem that is essentially extraneous to the main narrative:

> This is the story. An episode is thrown in of a giant and a captive príncess, who is gallantly rescued by Oisín. Whilst the episode is somewhat tedious, it is of a character frequent enough in the mediaeval tales of Europe, and it has two or three points in it of special interest.

Flannery's translation of the poem is presented in two ways: in a metrical style that attempted to recapture something of the rhyming nature of the original language version, and in a more literal form.

> The present edition contains the whole poem lopped of some excrescences and lightened of some interpolations ; it gives a literal translation for the sake of students and a new metrical version in the style and manner of the original — which the editor believes has not been attempted before. The divisions have been made and headings adopted to make the scope of the poem more clear, and they will it m hoped also make the poem easier to learn and to remember. For any who may think the word for word prose version not literal enough, there is a prettv full vocabulary of the text of the poem at the end of the book, all nicely arranged in alphabetical order, from which they can make a translation as literal — and as bald — as they like.

As well as providing his own translations, Flannery also reviewed several other versions.

For example, he remarked on the first popular translation of the poem:

> But not till 1859 was this fine poem printed — so difficult was it to get anything published in the Irish language. In tnat year it was at length brought before the public by Mr. Brian O'Looney who edited it — with an interesting introduction — for the *Irish Ossianic Society*, and on the version given by him in the fourth volume of that Society's *Transactions*, the present edition is mainly based. But during the hundred years of its unprinted existence, the poem could not fail to be altered, added to, and corrupted. Some of the versions current in the neighbouring counties of Galway and Mayo for instance differ considerably from the first printed edition — some are much longer, some shorter, some worse, a few in some respects better.

Flannery also reviewed other translations that had appeared since the original publication of the poem (which is to say, between 1859 and 1896):

> Since 1859 its attractiveness has made it a frequent theme for writers. Mr. O'Looney only gave a literal prose translation of his version ; it was followed in 1860 (or '61) by a metrical translation by 'A Member of the Ossianic Society' which was published by the late John O'Daly — but it was a most unworthy representation of the Irish poem. Next came Mr. T. D. Sullivan's very pleasing English poetical version — but it was more a *paraphrase* than a *translation*, did not give the whole story, and did not attempt the style or metre of the original. Mr. David Comyn — a namesake, and I believe a scion of the family of the original author, republished the Irish poem in 1880 for the Gaelic Union — keeping too closely however both to Mr. O'Looney's text and to his translation. But Mr. Comyn only gave a literal translation of the poem, accompanying it certainly with a very useful vocabulary. Now to translate a poem merely word for word, is I hold nothing less than *desecration* — it is treating it as a mere heap of words, or as a column of a dictionary — ignoring its chief value, namely, as *a piece of literature*. In his "Old Celtic Romances," Dr. Joyce gives a very readable but very brief prose summary of the story in English, and recently Mr. W. B. Yeats has published a poem called "The Wanderings of Ossian," but how far this is a translation of *Tír na nÓg* , I cannot say, as I have not seen it.

Reading through the "unworthy" metrical translation by the member of the Ossianic Society, it's not hard to see why Flannery didn't think much of it!

## The "Original" Translation

As Flannery noted, the translation that appeared to get things going appeared in volume IV (1856) of the Transactions of the Ossianic Society, published in 1859. It was prefaced with the following *caveat*:

> The Council of the Ossianic Society do not hold themselves responsible for the authenticity or antiquity of the following poem ; but print it as an interesting specimen of the most recent of the Fenian Stories. In the tract which follows it will be found one of the most ancient of the re- cords that describe the exploits of Finn Mac Gumhaill.

The translator, Brian O'Looney, provided the following introduction to his translation:

Tír Na Nóg — The Land of Youth

TO
WILLIAM SMITH O'BRIEN, ESQ.,
PRESIDENT OF THE OSSIANIC SOCIETY.

Sir,— Pursuant to your wishes, and at your very kind suggestion, I have undertaken the following translation of the Ossianic poem, on `Tir na n-Óg` (" Land of Youth,") in the humble but confident hope that I may, however, unpretending as an Irish scholar, be in some measure instrumental in restoring our *neglected lore* to its former style and standard.

From my knowledge of the Fenian stories, and Ossianic poems which circulate in this country, I would classify them under three different and distinct heads, 1st, Fenian history, which comprises all based upon fact aand supported by the ancient records and chronicles of our country, such as Cac 5A5ttA, Caz Cquca and the like, which it would be absurd to discredit against the forcible evidence of our trustworthy annals. 2nd, inventions and poetic Actions which are entertaining, and intended by the authors more to amuse the reader and to embellish history, than, as some say, to impose on his understanding, and claim the credit of truth. 3rd, the poems and prophecies of f 101717, Coftt]oU, CAO^lce, and others of the flAiyi)^ 6}ftiooi9 (Irish Militia), which are very interesting, and I should think entitled to as much credit as the early traditions of any other nation.

Some assume that the genuine old poems and stories cannot be distinguished from the modern Actions, and consequently that they cannot be credited, but that all must be considered worthless. This is a very unjustifiable assumption. The Irish scholar will at once know the composition of the Fenian period, as the language and style is different from that of latter times. From the fourteenth to the beginning of the eighteenth century, we bare another dais of poems and romantic tales, which exhibit a later stage of the language, but which are well worthy of attention. My own convlcton is that the Ossianic poem on the " Land of Youth" is of this last class and date, and from the testimony of many corroborating facts supported by the result of an inquiry which I instituted at your suggestion, I believe it to have been written by the learned Michael Comyn, contemporaneously with the romance of `Torolv mac Starn` (Torolv the son of Starn), about the year A.D. 1749. By comparing `Tir na n-Óg` with the occasionally interspersed verses in the romance of Torolv the son of Starn, Sec, whose author is universally acknowledged to be Michael Comyc, it will be perceived that there is such a similarity and almost identity of style in them as to leave no doubt that they are both the productions of the same master mind. As further proof of this I may state that an illiterate man of my acquaintance can repeat several verses of it, but knows it under no other name but that of Laio An Coimin (Comyn's Lay) and that his father had it from Comyn's manuscript. Another man states in a letter to me, that his copy of it was written in the year 1762 by a celebrated Irish scholar, who lived in Ruan, County of Glare. In this poem we have an account of Cf n 9A fh^Aome itfAjt^ (Land of the good people), the elysium of the Pagan Irish as related to St. Patrick by Oisin, when he returned to Erin after a lapse of more than three hundred years, which he spent in the enjoyment of all bliss, with his charming spouse, the golden headed (haired) Niamh. While Oisin sojourned in the paradise of perpetual youth, it was (it seems falsely) said of him that he was dead, but as those who enter the " Land of the Just" can never die, so Oisin lived until he returned to relate the history of his adventures, and of this happy elysium. The inhabitants, of the eastern countries believed that in the west there was a happy final abode for the just which was called `Tir na ????` (Land of the good people.)

This elysium is supposed to be divided into different states and provinces, each governed by its own king or ruler, such `Tir na n-Óg` (Land of youth) `Tir na ????` (Land of the Living) `Tir na ???` (Land of virtues) and several others. According to traditional geography and history the "Land of Youth" is the most charming country to be found or imagined, abounding in all that fancy could suggest or man could desire, and bestowing the peculiar virtue of perpetual youth, and hence the name. In the " Land of Virtues," or as some call it, the "Land of Victories" (but the latter name I suppose to be a mis-translation, as I have never heard of a battle or strife in this country); it is all peace, tranquility and happiness. As there is no conflict there can be no victory— and there is no virtue to be desired which is not to be had on entering this country ! The " Land of life" is supposed to give perpetual life to the departed spirits of the just. These are supposed to be located somewhere about the sun's setting point, and have means of approach, chiefly through the seas, lakes and rivers of this world, also through raths, duns and forts. The seas, lakes and riyers act as cooling atmospheres, while the raths, duns and forts, serve as places of ingress and egress to and from them. There are besides, different grand-gates, as it were, through, out the world, such asQU ScuinQ (Kill Stuifin), situate in liscannor Bey, supposed to be one of the chief entrances into `Tir na n-Óg` (" Land of youth.") This is said to be abeautiftil but small city, marked by the white breaking waves between Iaacc (Lahinch.) and lTor-CeAi)i7i&in (Liscannor). The white breaking wares, which are always seen in this part of the Bay, are said to be caused by the shallowness of the water over this enchanted little city, which is beliered to be seen once in seven years, and of which, it is observed, that those who see it shall depart this world before the lapse of seven years to come ; but it is not supposed that those persons die but change their abode, and transmigrate from this world of toil, into the elysium of the just, `Tir na n-Óg` (" Land of Youth,") where they shall, at once, become sportive, young and happy, and continue so for ever. It is also believed, that those who see those enchanted spots, are slightly endowed with the gift of prophecy, from the time they see it till they depart this world, and that they pass through this enchanted passage, so magically shewn them, prior to their departure. For further information on `Cill Stuifin` (Kill Stuifin), read Comyn's Romance, called `?? Torolv maic Staimn ??? a ??? mac` (the adventures of Torolv Mac Starn and his three sons). Contiguous to this place is another spot called C90C oa nos^^e (Fairy Hill), this was the ancient name of Lahinch, before the death of the Chieftain, O'Connor of Dumhach, (the Sand pits), who had been treacherously slain there, and in memory of whom there had been raised a monument called leAcc uj Coq- cubATft (O'Connor's monument), which in Irish is the present name of this little town, but in its anglicised form Lahinch, or Lahinchy, it has lost all sight of the old derivation. It was called Cooc pA 5105x60 (Fairy Hill), from its being the meeting place of the fairy nobles of this section of the country, who, it seems, lived on terms of intercourse with the nobles of `Tir na n-Óg` ("Land of Youth,") and this hill is traditionally believed to be the place where both tribes met and held their periodical conferences. The nobles of this country are said to live in the great and large duns, fortresses, lisses, and raths, and to act as agents to the nobles of Cfft 17A 9.65 (" Land of Youth,") and to those of all the states of the lower paradise. One of the duties of their station is to mark the persons suitable to the lower country, and by their supernatural power they meet or send messengers to carry off those persons. It is in the shape of a beautiful lady, such as `Niam Cinn oir` golden-headed, (haired) Niamh, that this messenger is generally seen. After the human creature whom she has visited has seen her, she vanishes in some magic way, and goes back to her own country. Ere long the person visited will pine away by some formal disease, and will be said to die, but fairy tradition proves that he or she (whichever it may be), does not die, but that they go into this elysium, where they will become young again and live for ever.

There are several such passages in this country, to describe which, would be both needless and endless. Suffice it to mention a few of the greatest celebrity— 16 or fb bfteAfAl (0*Breasail*s country), lb lefcfij, (0*Leihin's country), Inchiquin and Lough Gur. The great Earl of Desmond is supposed to have been submerged in the latter, where he is seen once in every seven years, anxiously awaiting the destined hour of return to his country. On reference to the ancient records and Pagan history of different nations, it will be seen that they have their traditions of Pagan elysiums as well as Ireland.

__LEGEND OF THE GREY SHEEP'S CAVE AT COOLAGAR-BONROE, NEAR KILBENNY.__

" Oisin went into the cave, met a beautiful damsel, after crossing the stream, lived with her for (as he fancied) a few days, wished to revisit the Fenians, obtained consent at last, on condition of not alighting from the white steed with which she furnished him, stating that it was over 300 years since he came to the cave. He proceeded till he met a carrier, whose cart, containing a bag of sand, was upset ; he asked Oisin to help him ; unable to raise the bag with one hand, he alighted, on which the steed fled, leaving him a *withered, decrepid, blind old man*."

" On a certain May morning long ago, a grey sheep was seen to come out of the cave, and to go to a neighbouring farmer's field, where she remained, until herself and her breed amounted to sixty grey sheep.

" The boy who took care of the sheep, was a widow's only son, a disciple of Pan ; for he played on the bag-pipes.

" His master, the farmer, ordered him one fine day to kill one of the sheep, he proceeded to the field for that purpose ; but the old sheep knowing his intention, and resolving to frustrate it, bleated three times, which instantly brought all the other black sheep around her, when they disappeared altogether into the cave. The boy followed them but having crossed the *enchanted stream* which runs through the cave, he was unable to return ; as no one ever re-crosscd it but Oisin. On reflecting on the anguish his loss and absence would cause his mother, he raised a mournful strain which he accompanied by the music of his bag-pispes. On every May day from that day to this, the lamentations of the boy, and the music of his pipes are heard in the cave."

In the preface to his literal translation (_"the first attempt made to suit the work to the use of schools"_), Comyn observes that the poem forms *'the prologue as it were to all the poems of the " Ossianic" school'* by providing an account of how Oisin was able to bridge the gap between Fionn's time and St Patrick's.

PREFACE

pp. v-viii

The present lay is perhaps the most modern of the great collection of poems and romances, called " Ossianic," composed by various bards, who for centuries have sung the great deeds and strange adventures of Fionn and the Fianna Eireann. Perhaps not one of all these rhapsodies and legends, which form so considerable and interesting a department of Gaelic literature, is, in its present shape, or in any other, the composition of Oisin, son of Fionn. Most of the "Ossianic" poems, however, are cast in the form of a dialogue between that personage and Saint Patrick, in which Oisin relates to the saint the stirring, romantic events, "all which he saw, great part of which he was," and by enlarging upon the supposed degeneracy of later days, magnifies the deeds of those heroes who, to him, seemed almost divine.

The age of any of the compositions forming this Ossianic literature cannot be exactly determined, but portions of it date back to the tenth and eleventh centuries, and some bear traces of even an earlier origin, from the days when the ancient paganism of Erin had not entirely faded from the land; but nearly all, as they have come down to us, through the course of ages, have become more or less changed from their original form, and most likely interpolated. Yet the character of the early legends, the ideas and opinions of the various actors, as shown in these truly dramatic tales and poems, have been preserved and faithfully transmitted from age to age. There is a class of Ossianic poems, which, though the work of modern bards, yet have retained so well the primitive ideas, style, and even phraseology as to be scarcely distinguishable from the modernised transcripts of ancient writings; and, by being also in the form of dialogue, imitate all the features of the original models : thus continuing the leading idea of the early poets in bringing face to face, as it were, the representatives of the Christian and Pagan systems in Ireland, in the persons of Saint Patrick and Óisin. To attain this end, and yet to avoid the anachronism of making the saint and Oisin contemporaneous, and parties to a dialogue, our bards availed themselves of the legends current in the country, detailing the circumstances and condition of the after life of the ancient heroes ; thus making Oisin, in the mysterious manner described in the present poem, sojourn for a lengthened period in the land of perpetual youth and happiness, and bringing him back from thence to be a witness of the ancient state of his country when its pristine manners had become changed and forgotten. This " Lay" is therefore the prologue as it were to all the poems of the " Ossianic" school. Other legends are also current of ancient heroes who had departed to " the Elysian fields," and who were made return to help our poets out of similar difficulties. The Classic writers, Vergil and Luciau for instance, were not so scrupulous as regards bringing together personages who lived in different ages and regions.

The present has a great many of the characteristics of the early Ossianic poems, and is a very faithful reproduction of the style and of the ideas expressed in them, if indeed, its author has not embodied some ancient rhymes, now perhaps lost, except the portions in this work. This poem of " Oisin, in the land of perpetual youth," to the authorship or date of which we have no record, is, in its present form, considered by some authorities to be the work of Michael Comyn, a poet of the county Clare, and author of several Irish poems and romances, who flourished in the early part of the last century. The legend at any rate is very familiar and popular among the Irish speaking people of his native district, many of whom can repeat considerable portions of this favourite poem. It has also been long known in the Highlands of Scotland. It has been several times published and frequently translated into English, both in metre and in prose ; but the present is the first attempt made to suit the work to the use of schools, by giving a translation exactly literal rather than elegant, yet at the same time not unreadable, and by annexing a copious vocabulary, as was done in the three lesson books issued by the society, yet of necessity more exhaustive in the present instance. Few notes have been given, but the information which would be contained in notes is embodied in the vocabulary " under each word requiring explanation. The genitive and plural of nouns, comparative of adjectives, and infinitive of verbs have also been given under each root word, with the addition of any other inflected forms which happened to occur in the text.
