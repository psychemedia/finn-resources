## The Lay of Oisín in the Land of Youth

It is likely that the tale as told by the late 19th century and early twentieth century folklorists derives from renditions of, Coulmin's 18th century poem *The lay of Oisín in the land of youth*, though the legend is undoubtedly older.

Several out-of-copyright translations of the poem can be readily found via `archive.org`.

This first example is by Thomas Flannery, published in 1896. Flannery provides some historical context for the origins of the poem in his introduction:

> The Irish poem given in the following pages is the composition of *Micheál Coimín* — anglicè 'Comyn' or 'Cummin' — a native of the County of Clare, who was born about the year 1688, at Kilcorcoran, near Miltown-Malbay, and died in 1760. The date of the poem may be given approximately as 1750.
>
> It is called the *Laoi Oisín* partly because Oisín is the hero of the story, partly because he is represented also as the narrator — after the manner of many mediaeval and later poets who loved to grace their own compositions with the name of the ancient bard. But it does not pretend to be an ancient poem — it is just the language of one of the better educated Irish poets of Munster of the middle of the last century — however ancient the legend itself and the traditions it embodies. It is also known as *Laoi ah Choimímg* or 'Comyn's Lay'. For more than a hundred years it existed only in manuscript, copies of the story passed from hand to hand, and in this way and by oral transmission it gradually spread to the neighbouring counties of Kerry, Galway, Mayo — the western counties generally of Ireland, and even to the west of Scotland.

In introducing the poem, Flannery provides a summary of the story it relates, a tale we are now familiar with:

> The story in outline is this. Whilst Finn and his Fenians are one day hunting around Loch Lein — otherwise the Lakes of Killarney — a lady of dazzling beauty suddenly appears, mounted on a white steed, coming apparently up from the sea. She meets Finn and tells him she has come from the Land of Youth, has heard of the fame and doughty deeds of his son Oisín, she loves him, and wants him to go with her to *Tír na nÓg*. She describes the charms and joys of that lovely land, and Oisín gladly consents to go away with her. They go away and at length reach Tir na nÓg where they are wedded. After many years of blissful life, Oisín longs to see Erin once more — longs to see his father Finn and gallant friends of former days. With much weeping and pleading Oisín's wife at length consents to let him go, pledging him not to dismount from his horse, or he will never be able to return. Oisín accepts the pledge, returns to Erin, is amazed to find he has been away for three hundred years, is grieved beyond measure to learn that Finn and the Fenians are no more, and resolves to go back at once ; but in his generous attempt to help some workmen out of a difficulty, wishing at the same time perhaps to show his great strength, by a most melancholy accident he is thrown off his horse, he suddenly becomes a blind, old man — a mortal once more, fated never to return to the Land of Youth.

Flannery also reviews an additional scene included in the poem that is essentially extraneous to the main narrative:

> This is the story. An episode is thrown in of a giant and a captive príncess, who is gallantly rescued by Oisín. Whilst the episode is somewhat tedious, it is of a character frequent enough in the mediaeval tales of Europe, and it has two or three points in it of special interest.

Flannery's translation of the poem is presented in two ways: in a metrical style that attempted to recapture something of the rhyming nature of the original language version, and in a more literal form.

> The present edition contains the whole poem lopped of some excrescences and lightened of some interpolations ; it gives a literal translation for the sake of students and a new mefcrical version in the style and manner of the original — which the editor believes has not been attempted before. The divisions have been made and headings adopted to make the scope of the poem more clear, and they will it m hoped also make the poem •easier to learn and to remember. For any who may think the word for word prose version not literal enough, there is a prettv full vocabulary of the text of the poem at the end of the book, all nicely arranged in alphabetical order, from whicb they can make a translation as literal — and as bald — as they like.

1896 includes a narrative translation

THE LAY CF OISIN IN THE LAND OF YOUTH As he told it to St. Patrick. 

PROLOGUE.

I.  
Patrick : O noble Oisín, son of the king,  
Whose deeds men sing this day in song !  
Thy grief abate and to us relate  
By what strange fate thou hast lived so long !

II.  
Oisín : O Patrick, here's the tale for thee,  
Tho' sad to me its memories old —  
'Twas after Gavra — I mind me well,  
The field where fell my Oscar bold !

THE LAY:

I. GOLDEN-HAIRED NIAMH.

III.  
One day the generous Finn my sire  
With olden fire led forth the chase —  
But our band was small when gather'd all,  
For past recall were the hosts of our race.

IV.  
'Twas a summer's morn and a mist hung o'er  
The winding shore of sweet Loch Lein,  
Where fragrant trees perfume the breeze  
And birds e'er please with a joyous strain.

V.  
We soon awoke the woodland deer  
That forced by fear fled far away —  
Keenly our hounds with strenuous bounds  
O'er moors and mounds pursued their prey.

VI.  
When lo ! into sight came a figure bright,  
In a blaze of light from the west it rushed—  
A lady fair of radiance rare  
Whom a white steed bare to our band, now hush'd !

VII.  
Amazed we halt, though hot the chase,  
To gaze on the face of the fair young queen—  
A marvel to Finn and his Fenian band  
Who ne'er in the land such beauty had seen !

VIII.  
A golden crown on her brow she bore,  
A mantle she wore of silken sheen  
All studded with stars of bright red gold —  
Ample each fold fell on herbage green.

IX.  
Her golden hair all fair to view  
In golden curls on her shoulders fell —  
Bright and pure were her eyes of blue  
As drops of the dew in a blue hare-bell,

X.  
Ruddier far her cheek than the rose  
Her bosom more white than the swan's so free,  
Sweeter the breath of her balmy mouth  
Than spice of the south from over the sea.

XI.  
Her milk-white steed was of worth untold  
Nor bridle of gold did the charger lack —  
A saddle all covered with purple and gold  
Lay bright to behold on the steed's proud back

XII.  
Four shoes of gold his hoofs did guard,  
Of gold unmarred by mixture base,  
A silver wreath on his crest was shown —  
Such steed was unknown on the earth's fair face.

XIII.  
To Finn's great presence drew the maid  
This bright array'd and softly spake —  
" King of the Fenian host, " she cried  
" Far have I hied for sweet love's sake ! "

XIV.  
" Who art thou, pray, O princess rare,  
Of form most fair, of face divine ?  
Gently thy errand to us make known —  
What land's thine own, what name is thine ? "

XV.  
" Niamh the Golden-haired I'm named,  
— O Finn far-famed for wisdom and truth ! —  
My praise harps ring, and bards e'er sing,  
And my sire's the King of the Land of Youth ! "

XVI.  
" Then tell us most lovely lady now,  
Why comest thou o'er seas so far ?  
Has heartless husband left thee to weep  
With grief most deep, thy mind to mar !"

XVII.  
" No husband has left me, O lordly Finn,  
— My heart within ne'er man did gain,  
Till hero of Erin, thy famous son,  
Its young love won, for aye to reign ! "

XVIII.  
" On which of my gallant sons, O maid,  
Is thy heart's love laid, so frankly free ?  
Now hide not from us, O princess dear,  
The causes clear of thy visit to me ! "

XIX.  
" His name, O Finn, then I'll declare —  
'Tis thy famed son, so fair, so brave,  
Oisín the warrior, Erin's bard,  
My fair reward for crossing the wave ! "

XX.  
" Then why hast thou hastened to give thy love  
O maiden above all maids most fair —  
To Oisín my own beyond all known  
Of princes high both rich and rare ? "

XI.  
" Good cause I ween for my course 'he &ecn,  
O king of tbe Fiann when I tell thee truth,  
Oisín's high deeds and noble name  
Have won him fame in the Land of Youth.

XXII.  
" Full many a prince of high degree  
Hath offered me both heart and hand  
But whoso appealed I ne'er did yield  
But my heart kept sealed for my hero grand ! "

XXIII.  
Oisín: O Patrick stern, how my soul did yearn  
And with ardour burn for the peerless maid —  
No shame to tell — each word was a spell,  
That bound me well past mortal aid.

XXIV.  
I took her gentle hand in mine  
And with every sign of love I said,  
" Welcome a hundred thousand times,  
From fairy climes, O royal maid ! "

XXY.  
" Of women the rarest, fairest seen,  
Thou art O queen, without compeer !  
My soul, my life, my chosen wife,  
Star of my way of ray most clear ! "

II. THE DELIGHTS OF THE LAND OF YOUTH.

XXVI.  
" Request refused by no true knight  
Who knoweth aright the knightly vogue,  
I make of thee now — 'tis hence to speed  
With me on my steed to *Tír na n-Óg*.

XXVII.  
Delightful land beyond all dreams !  
Beyond what seems to thee most fair —  
Rich fruits abound the bright year round  
And flowers are found of hues most rare.

XXVIII.  
Unfailing there the honey and wine  
And draughts divine of mead there be,  
No ache nor ailing night or day —  
Death or decay thou ne'er shalt see !

XXIX.  
" The mirthful feast and joyous play  
And musíc's sway all blest, benign—  
Silver untold and store of gold  
Undreamt by the old shall all be thine !

XXX.  
" A hundred swords of steel refined  
A hundred cloaks of kind full rare,  
A hundred steeds of proudest breed  
A hundred hounds — thy meed when there !

XXXI.  
" A hundred coats of mail shall be thine  
A hundred kine of sleekest skin,  
A hundred sheep with fleece of gold  
And gems none hold these shores within.

XXXII.  
" A hundred maidens young and fair  
Of blithesome air shall tend on thee,  
Of form most meet, as fairies fleet  
And of song more sweet than the wild thrush free !

XXXIII,  
" A hundred knights in fights most bold  
Of skill untold in all chivalrie,  
Full-armed, bedight in mail of gold  
Shall in *Tír na n-Óg* thy comrades be.

XXXIV.  
" A corslet charmed for thee shall be made  
And a matchless blade of magic power,  
Worth a hundred blades in a hero's hands,  
Most blest of brands in battle's hour !

XXXV.  
"The royal crown of the King of Youth  
Shall shine in sooth on thy brow most fair,  
All brilliant with gems of lustre bright  
Whose worth aright none might declare.

XXXVI.  
" All things I've named thou shalt enjoy  
And none shall cloy — to endless life —  
Beauty and strength and power thou'lt see  
And I'll e'er be thy own true wife ! "

XXXVII.  
" Refusal of mine thou ne'er shalt hear  
O maid without peer, of the locks of gold !  
My chosen wife for life I know  
And gladly I'll go to *Tír na n-Óg*!"

III. THE DEPARTURE TO Tír NA N-ÓG.

XXXVIII.  
Forthwith the steed I then bestrode  
Before me rode my royal queen  
Who said " O Oisín with caution ride  
Till side of dividing sea we've seen ! "

XXXIX.  
Then up rose that steed with a mighty bound  
Gave forth three sounding startling neighs,  
His mane he shook, then with fiery look  
His riders he took to the sea's known ways.

XL.  
Now when from Finn and the Fenian host  
The steed to the coast was coursing so,  
There burst from the chief a cry of grief  
A wail of grief not brief nor low.

XLI.  
" Oh Oisín " cried Finn with faltering voice —  
" My son most choice must I then lose,  
With never a hope to see thee again ?  
— My heart in twain 'twill break and bruise!"

XLII.  
His noble features now clouded o'er  
And tears did pour in showers free  
Till breast and beard in tears were drowned —  
" My grief ! he e'er found this maid from the Sea ! "

XLIII.  
Oh Patrick I grieve to tell thee the tale  
My words now fail to find their way —  
How the father did part from the son of his heart,  
My tears e'er start when I think of the day.

XLIV.  
I drew up the steed for a moment's rest  
And tenderly pressed on my sire a kiss,  
Then bade farewell to the Fenian band  
Tho' the tears did stand in my eyes, I wis,

XLV.  
Full many a day great Finn and I  
And our host all nigh in gay array  
Held glorious feast where harps ne'er ceased  
And highest and least had their choice alway.

XLVI.  
Full oft our race held a royal chase  
While at boldest pace ran our sweet-voiced hounds —  
Anon in battle our javelins rattle  
And men like cattle fall in heaps and mounds !

XLVII.  
Patrick : O vain old Oisín, dwell no more  
On thy deeds of yore in the Fenian ranks,  
How didst thou go to *Tír na n-Óg* ?  
Come let me know and I'll owe much thanks.

XLVIII.  
Oisín : We turned away as I truly said  
And our horse's head we gave to the west,  
When lo ! the deep sea opened before  
While behind us bore the billows that pressed.

XLIX.  
Anon we saw in our path strange sights,  
Cities on heights and castles fair,  
Palaces brilliant with lights and flowers —  
The brightest of bowers were gleaming there.

L.  
And then we saw a yellow young fawn  
Leap over a lawn of softest green,  
Chased by a graceful, snow-white hound  
That with airy bound pressed on most keen.

LI.  
We next beheld— I tell thee true,  
A maid in view on a bright bay steed,  
An apple of gold in her hand did she hold,  
O'er the waves most bold she hied with speed.

LII.  
And soon we saw another sight  
A youthful knight who a white steed rode,  
The rider in purple and crimson array'd  
Whilst a glittering blade in his hand he showed.

LIII.  
" Yon youthful pair bothlcnight and maid —  
" Pray tell " I said " who they may be—  
The lady mild as a summer's morn  
And knight high-born that fares so free."

LIV.  
" In all thy sight may light on here  
O Oisín dear, I say with truth,  
There's nought of beauty, nought of strength,  
Till we reach at length the Land of Youth!"

IV. — FOVOR OF THE BLOWS.

LV.  
And now as we rode we came in sight  
Of a palace bright, high-placed, and strong,  
Shapely its hall and lofty its wall  
Far beyond all e'er famed in song.

LVI.  
" What royal *Dún* is yon, O queen,  
That stands serene on yon hill-side,  
Whose towers and columns so stately spring —  
What prince or king doth there abide ? "

LVII.  
" In yonder *Dún* a sad queen dwells  
Whom force compels her life to mourn —  
Whom Fovor fierce of the Mighty Blows  
Doth there enclose from friends' arms torn.

LVIII.  
" But captive though to that pirate proud  
She yet hath vowed by geasa grave,  
Never for life to be his wife  
Till won in strife 'gainst champion brave ! "

LIX.  
"Blessing and bliss be thine " I cried  
" O maid bright eyed, for thy welcome word,  
Tho' grieved that woman such fate should meet  
Music more sweet I ne'er have heard !

LX.  
" For now we'll go to that high-placed *Dún*  
And help full soon that maid distressed,  
A champion's steel shall Fovor feel  
And 'neath my heel shall his neck be pressed ! "

LXI.  
To Fovor's stronghold then we rode-—  
Unblest abode for a captive sweet !  
Atonce the queen with joyous mien,  
Came forth on the green with welcome meet.

LXII.  
In robe of rich-hued silk arrayed  
Was this queenly maid with the brow of snow,  
Her neck all fair could with swan's compare  
Her cheeks did wear the rose's glow.

LXIII.  
Of golden hue was her hair, 'tis true,  
Of heavenly blue her bright eyes clear,  
Her lips were red as berries on bough,  
Shapely each brow with rare compeer !

LXIV.  
To seat ourselves we then were told —  
In a chair of gold each one sat down,  
Most royal fare was set forth there  
In royal ware of great renown.

LXV.  
Now when of food we had had our fill  
And of wine as will might fancy e'en,  
Thus spoke the queen, her face now pale,  
Now list my tale, with ears all keen !

LXVI.  
From first to last she told her tale  
Her cheek all pale and wet with tears —  
How kith and kin ne'er more she'd see  
Whilst Fovor free provoked her fears.

LXVII.  
" Then weep no more, O fair young queen,  
Henceforth I ween, thou needst not mourn,  
Fovor shall pay with his life this day  
In mortal fray for the wrongs thou'st borne!"

LXVIII.  
" Alas ! no champion can be found  
On earth's great round, I fear me much,  
Could hand to hand such foe withstand  
Or free me from this tyrant's clutch. "

LXIX.  
" I tell thee truly lady fair  
I'll boldly dare him to the field  
Resolved to save thee or in strife  
Never while life doth last to yield !"

LXX.  
Ere cease my words, in savage trim  
The giant grim against us hies —  
In skins of beasts uncouthly clad,  
Whilst a club he had of monstrous size.

LXXI.  
No salutation from him came  
But his eyes aflame glared all around,  
Forthwith he challenged me to fight  
And I with delight took up my ground.

LXXII.  
For full three nights and eke three days  
Our deadly fray's end seemed in doubt  
Till at length his head with my sword I sped  
O'er the plain now red with the blood pour'd out!

LXXIII  
Now when the two young maids beheld  
Fierce Fovor felled by my good sword,  
They gave three shouts of joy and glee  
Of joy for freedom now restored.

LXXIV.  
We then returned to the giant's *dún*  
Where faint in swoon at last I fell,  
Faint from wounds and loss of blood  
That still in flood gushed like a well.

LXXV.  
But now the maid from Fovor freed  
Ran up with speed to help me fain —  
My wounds she washed, and bathed with balm,  
And health and calm I found again,

LXXVI.  
The giant grim we buried him  
Deep down in earth in widest grave —  
We raised a stone his grave to note  
And his name we wrote in Ogham-craev.

LXXVII.  
A merry feast we then did hold  
And stories told of olden days —  
And when night fell we rested well  
On couches such as poets praise.

LXXVIII.  
When morning fair the sun did greet  
From slumbers sweet we fresh awoke —  
" Dear friends from hence I now depart—  
'Twas thus the parting princess spoke.

LXXIX,  
We soon equipped us for our way  
For longer stay was needed not,  
Sad, sorrowful the leave we took,  
And sad the princess' look, I wot.

LXXX.  
The further fate of that sweet maid  
O Patrick staid, I could not tell,  
No word of her I've heard one say  
E'er since the day we said farewell

V. — IN THE LAND OF YOUTH.

LXXXI  
We turned once more upon our course  
And wildly sped our horse along —  
No wind that sweeps the mountain drift  
Was half so swift or half so strong.

LXXXII.  
But now the sky began to lower,  
The wind in power increased full fast —  
Red lightning lights the mad sea-waves  
And madly raves the thunder past !

LXXXIII.  
A while we cowered 'neath the storm,  
— All nature's form in darkness dread —  
When lo ! the winds' fierce course was run,  
And bright the sun appear'd o'erhead !

LXXXIV.  
And now there spread before our sight  
A land most bright, most rich, and fair,  
With hill and plain and shady bower  
And a royal tower of splendour rare.

LXXXV.  
And ín this royal mansion fair  
All colours were that eye hath seen—  
The blue most bright, the purest white  
With purple and yellow and softest green.

LXXXVI.  
To left and right of this palace bright  
Rose many a hall and sun-lit tower,  
All built of brilliant gems and stones  
By hands one owns of wondrous power.

LXXXVII.  
" What lovely land is that we see ?  
Pray answer me with maiden's truth—  
Is't penned in page that man may read,  
Or is it indeed the Land of Youth ?

LXXXVIII.  
" It is indeed the Land of Youth —  
And maiden's truth I've ever told —  
No joy or bliss I've promised thee  
But thou shalt see this land doth hold ! "

XXXIX.  
And now there rode frorn the king's abode  
To meet us on the lawn of green  
Thrice fifty champions of might  
In armour bright, of noble mien.

XC.  
And then there came in hues arrayed  
A hundred maids in maiden vogue —  
In silken garments bright and brave  
Who welcome gave to *Tír na n-Óg* .

XCI.  
And next marcbed forth a chosen band  
Of the troops of that land, a lovely sight —  
A king at their head of kingly tread  
Of mighty name and fame in fight.

XCII.  
A yellow shirt of silken weft,  
A cloak most deftly broidered o'er  
On the king in folds hung freely down  
Whilst a glittering crown on his head he wore.

XCIIÍ.  
And close behind him there was seen  
His youthful queen — a consort meet –  
With fifty maidens in her train  
Who sang a strain divinely sweet,

XCIV.  
Then spoke the king in kindly voice,  
" O friends rejoice, for here you see  
Oisín the famous son of Finn,  
Who spouse of winsome Niamh shall be ! "

XCV.  
He takes me warnly by the hand  
Then as we stand he speaks anew —  
" Welcome " he cries " I give thee now,  
A hundred thousand welcomes true !

XCVI.  
This kingdom which o'er seas and lands  
Thou'st sought, now stands reveal'd to thee  
Long shalt thou live our race among  
And ever young as thou shalt see.

XCVII.  
No pleasure e'er that entered mind  
But here thou'lt find without alloy,  
This is the land thy bards e'er sing  
And I am the King of this Land of Joy.

XCVIII.  
" Here is our gentle, fair young queen,  
Mother of Niamh the Golden-baired  
Who crossed for thee the stormy sea  
And thine to be all dangers dared ! "

XCIX.  
I thanked the king with grateful heart  
To the queen apart I bowed me low —  
We tarried no longer without the walls  
But entered the halls of *Ri na n-Óg* .

C.  
There came the nobles of all that land  
The great and grand to sing our praise—  
And feast was held with all delights  
For ten long nights and ten long days.

CI.  
I then was wedded to Gold-haired Niamh —  
And there to leave the tale were well —  
Thus did I go to Tír-na-n-Og  
Though grief and woe 'tis now to tell.

CII.  
Patrick : Come finish the charming tale thou'st told,  
O Oisín of gold, of the weapons of war—  
Why from such land didst thou e'er return ?  
I fain would learn what the causes are.

CIII.  
And say whilst there thou didst abide  
If thee thy bride any children bore,  
Or wast thou for long in the Land of Youth ? —  
I long in truth to list such lore !

CIV.  
Oisín : I had by Niamh of the Golden Hair  
Three children fair as ever smiled  
Whose sweetness gave us daily joys—  
Two gallant boys and a maiden mild.

CV.  
Patrick : O sweet-voiced Oisín, do not grieve, —  
Where didst thou leave those children sweet?  
Tell me the names of thy offspring fair,  
And tell me where they mirthful meet.

CVI.  
Oisín : Those children three rich heirs would be  
To kingdoms free and fair and great,  
To roval sceptre, crown of gold  
And wealth untold, no tongue could state.

CVII.  
My gentle Niamh on her boys bestowed  
The names I owed most honour to —  
Finn the bright of the hosts of might,  
And Oscar who'd fight for the right and true

CVIII.  
And I my daughter fair did call  
By a name which all fair names o'ershades —  
In beauty's virtue and sweetness , power  
By rightful dower — the Flower-of-Maids

VI. The return from Tír-na-n-Óg.

CIX.  
Long lived I there as now appears  
Tho' short the years seemed e'er to me,  
Till a strong desire of my heart took hold  
Finn and my friends of old to see.

CX.  
One day of the king I asked for leave  
And of loving Niamh who grieved the while,  
To visit dear Erin once again  
My native plain, my native isle.

CXI.  
" I will not hinder thee, " she cried,  
" From crossing the tide for duty dear,  
Tho' it bodes me ill and my heart doth fill  
With doubts that chill and deadly fear ! "

CXII.  
" Why shouldst thou fear, O queen my own,  
When the way shall be shown by the magic steed  
The steed that bore us o'er the sea —  
And home to thee I'll safely speed ? "

CXIII.  
" Remember then what now I say —  
If thou shouldst lay a foot to ground  
There's no return for thee e'ermore  
To this fair shore where home thou'st found !

CXIV.  
I tell thee truly vain's thy might  
Shouldst thou alight from thy white steed,  
For never again shouldst thou in truth  
See Land of Youth or hither speed.

CXV.  
" A third time now I thee implore  
And beg thee sore thy seat to hold,  
Or else at once thy strength shall go,  
And thou shalt grow both blind and old !

CXVI.  
" 'Tis woe to me, Oisín, to see  
How thou canst be so anxious-soul'd  
About green Erin, changed for aye —  
For past's the day of the Fenians bold.

CXVII.  
In Erin green there's now nought seen  
But priests full lean and troops of saints —  
Then Oisín, here's my kiss to thee,  
Our last, may be — my heart — now faints ! "

CXVIII.  
I gazed into her soft sad eyes  
Whilst the tears did rise and well in my own —  
O saint severe, thou'dst weep a tear  
To hear that dear wife's hopeless moan !

CXIX.  
By solemn vow I then was bound,  
To Erin's ground ne'er to descend,  
And if to keep this vow I failed  
No power availed or could befriend.

CXX.  
I pledged to keep my solemn vow  
And do all now enjoined had been,  
I mounted then my steed of spell  
And said farewell to king and queen.

CXXI.  
I kissed once more my Gold-haired Niamh,  
— My heart doth grieve as I tell the tale —  
I kissed my sons and daughter young  
Whose hearts were wrung and cheeks were pale.

CXXII.  
I turned my steed at last to the strand  
And passed from the Land of Lasting Youth —  
Boldly my horse pursued his course  
And the billows' force was nought in sooth.

CXXIII.  
O Patrick of the orders pure  
No lie, full sure, I'e told but truth,  
Thus have I tried my tale to weave  
And thus did I leave the Land of Youth

CXXIV.  
If of good bread I could get my fill  
As Finn at will gave to each guest  
Each day I'd pray to the King of Grace  
That Heaven might be thy place of rest.

CXXV.  
Patrick : Thou shalt of bread have quite thy fill  
And drink at will, O ancient bard !  
Dear to me thy pleasant tale !  
It ne'er can fail to win regard.

VII. Oisín in Erin.

CXXVI.  
Oisín : I need not tell each thing befell  
Me and my spell-borne steed each day,  
But at length green Erin's isle we reach,  
And up the beach we bend our way.

CXXVII.  
When once I found my steed trod ground,  
I looked arouad on every side,  
Anxious for tidings small or great  
Of Finn and his state, once Erin's pride.

CXXVIII.  
Not long in doubt had I thus stayed  
When a cavalcade came up the way —  
Strange crowd, I thought, of women and men  
And past my ken their strange array.

CXXIX.  
Right gentlv they saluted me  
But marvell'd much to see my size,  
They marvell'd at my wondrous steed  
For on such breed they'd ne'er set eyes.

CXXX.  
I asked — with fear my heart within —  
If the noble Finn were yet alive,  
Or if his hosts that kept the coasts  
Of Erin safe, did yet survive.

CXXXI.  
" Of Finn, " they said, " we oft have heard —  
His name and fame are now world-wide,  
But full three hundred years have passed  
Since Finn and the last of the Fenians died.

CXXXII.  
" Many a book and many a tale  
Have bards of the Gael that treat of Finn —  
Of his strength and valour and wisdom bright  
Of his race of might and mighty kin.

CXXXIII.  
" We've also heard of Finn's great son—  
A youth of wondrous mien and mould,  
That a lady came hither from over the sea  
And with her went he to *Tír na n-Óg* "

CXXXIV.  
Now when those words fell on mine ear —  
That Finn and his heroes were no more —  
My heart was chilled — my soul was filled  
With woe unwilled ne'er felt before.

CXXXV.  
I stopped no longer upon my course  
But swift my horse urged onward flew —  
Till Alvin's hill o'er Leinster's plain  
Rose once again before my view.

CXXXVI.  
What shock I felt none could report,  
To see the court of Finn of the steeds  
A ruin lone, all overgrown  
With nettles and thorns and rankest weeds!

CXXXVIl.  
I found alas, 'twas a vain pursuít,  
A bootless, fruitless, visit mine !  
Great Finn was dead and the hosts he led  
For this I'd sped thro' ocean's brine !

CXXXVIIX.  
But let me tell my story all—  
Tho' Alvin's roofless hall I'd seen,  
I still would see spots dear to me  
Where Fenians free and Finn had been.

CXXXIX.  
In passing through the Thrushes' Glen  
A crowd of men in straits I see,  
Full thrice five score and haply more  
At toil full sore awaited me.

CXL.  
Then forth there spoke a man of that herd  
With suppliant word to me address'd —  
" Come to our help, O champion brave,  
Come quick to save us thus distress'd ! "

CXLI.  
I rode up briskly to the crowd  
And found them bow'd beneath a weight—  
A flag of marble great and long  
Bore down the throng who moaned their fate.

CXLII.  
Now all who tried to lift that stone  
Did pant and groan most piteously —  
Till some its crushing weight drove mad  
And some fell dead, most sad to see !

CXLIII.  
Then cried a steward of that crowd  
And said aloud, " O haste and hie,  
O gallant knight to our relief  
Or else 'tis brief ere all shall die ! "

CXLIV.  
"A shameful thing it is to say —  
For such array of men these days —  
They're powerless of blood and bone  
Full easily that stone to raise ! "

CXLV.  
" If Oscar, Oisín's valiant son  
Laid hold upon that marble stone  
With right hand bare he'd hurl't in air  
Flinging it fair, with ne'er a groan ! "

CXLVI.  
Asked thus for help I did not lag  
Bur 'neath the flag I placed one hand —  
Full perches seven that stone I hurl  
And scare each churl in all that band !

CXLVII.  
But scarce alas ! that stone had passed  
With that fair cast when ah ! the strain —  
The strain it broke the white steed's girth,  
I fell to earth, doomed now to pain !

CXLVIII.  
No sooner had I touched the ground  
Than with abound my steed took fright —  
Away, away, to the west he rushed !  
Whilst all stood hush'd at such strange sight !

CXLIX.  
At once I lose the sight of my eyes,  
My youth's bloom dies, lean age began,  
And I was left of strength bereft  
A helpless, hopeless, blind old man l

CL.  
O Patrick, now the tale thou hast,  
As each thing passed, indeed, in truth,  
My going away, my lengthened stay,  
And return for aye from the Land of Youth !  
Thus far the Lay of Oisín in the Land of Youth.

Laoi Oisín as ṫir na n-óg — The lay of Oisín in the land of youth
by Coimín, Micheál, 1676-1760; Flannery, Thomas, 1846-1916
1896 includes a narrative translation

Literally :

1. O noble Oisín, O son of the king, who was best in deed of valour and battle, relate to us now without grief how thou hast lived after all the other Fenians.

2. I will tell thee that, O new-come Patrick, though sad to me to speak of it aloud — 'twas after the hard-fought field of Gavra, where alas, was slain the valiant Oscar !

3. One day as we the Fenians were all (assembled) — the generous Finn and all that survived of us — though sad (and) sorrowful our converse after our heroes had been laid low—

4. At a hunt on a misty morning on the circling shores of Loch Lein, where there were trees most fragrant of bloom and musie at all times sweetly (sung) by birds —

5. Literally : There was roused by us the hornless doe that was best in bounding, running and (all) activity — our hounds and dogs were all close after her in full chase.

6. It was not long till we saw a swift rider coming towards us from the west — a youthful maiden who was most beautiful of countenance, on a graceful white steed most fleet in movement.

7. We all halted from the chase at the sight of the countenance of the royal lady — wonder seized Finn and the Fenians who had never (before) seen a woman so beautiful.

8. There was a royal crown upon her head and (she had) a dark-brown mantle of costly silk stamped with stars of red gold, covering her shoes down to the grass.

9. A ringlet of gold was hanging down from each yellow tress of her golden hair — her blue eyes (were) clear and cloudless as a dew-drop on a blade of grass.

10. Her cheek was redder than the rose, her complexion fairer than (hue of) the swan upon the wave, sweeter yet was the taste of her little mouth than honey that is taken (mixed) with red wine.

11. A cloth wide, long, and smooth was covering the white steed, (there was) a saddle adorned with red gold, and (she held) a gold-bitted bridle in her right hand.

12. Four shapely shoes were under him of yellow gold of the finest quality, a wreath of silver (he had) in the back of his head — not in the world was thero a better steed.

13. She came into the presence of Finn and spoke in a tone gentle and earnest, and said : " O king of the Fianns, long and from afar has been my journey ! "

14. " Who art thou thyself, O young queen, O woman best in figure, beauty, and countenance ? Relate to us now thy story from the beginning and tell us thy name and thy land ! "

15. "Niamh of the Head of Gold is my own name, O most valiant Finn of the great hosts — beyond (all) the women of the world I have gained fame, and I am the fair daughter of the King of Youth."

16. " Tell us, O gentle queen, the cause of thy coming over the sea from afar — is it thy husband who has gone from thee, or what is the trouble that is on thee? "

17. " It is not that husband has gone from me — never yet have I been pledged to any man, O Fenian King of the highest fame — but affection and love I have given to thy son."

18. " To which of my sons O blooming maid, hast thou given love and liking? Do not hide from us now the (whole) cause, but tell us thy trouble, O woman! "

19. "I myself will tell thee that, O Finn — it is thy lovable, handsome son, of the hard weapons, high-minded Oisín of the strong arms — he is the hero that I now speak of."

20. " What is the cause for which thou hast given love — O beautiful maid of the glossy hair — to my own fair Oisín beyond all others, (seeing that there are) so many high princes under the sun ? "

21. " Not without cause O king of the Fenians, have I come from afar for him, but I received an account of him, of his excellence of body and mind.

22. "It is many a king's son and high prince have offered me love and lasting affection, I never consented to (accept) any man till I gave love to the valiant Oisín ! "

23. By that hand on thee O Patrick — and not shameful for me to tell it — there was not a part of me but was in love with the beautiful maid of the glossy hair.

24. I took her hand in mine and said moreover with sweet-toned voice " The kindest welcome I give thee to this land O lovely youthful queen ! "

25. " Thou art the brightest and fairest of bloom, 'tis thou I should prefer for wife – thou art my choice above the women of the world, O kindly star of the brightest look ! "

26. "Commands that true heroes do not disregard I impose on thee now, O generous Oisín, to come with me on my horse and (thus) go away to *Tír na n-Óg*.

27. " It is the most delightful land to be found in the world, the land of most renown now beneath the sun — the trees bending with fruit and blossom, and foliage growing to the tips of the branches.

28. " Abundant in it are (the) honey and wine and everything (good) that eye hath seen, decay shalL not come upon thee with thou shalt not see failure or death !

29. " Thou shalt get feasting, play, and drinking, thou shalt get music most sweet on harp-string, thou shalt get silver and gold, and thou shalt get also ahundance of jewels.

30. " Thou shalt have a hundred swords and no deceit, and a hundred mantles of satin of costly quality, thou shalt have a hundred steeds most swift in battle, thou shalt have with them a hundred keen hounds.

31. "Thou shalt have a hundred suits of armour and shirts of satin, a hundred cows and also a hundred calves, thou shalt have a hundred sheep with fleeces of gold, thou shalt have a hundred gems that are not to be found in this world (of thine).

32. " Thou shalt have a hundred handmaids young and mirthful, bright and glorious as the sun, of the best features, figure, and complexion, whose voices are sweeter than the song of birds.

33. "Thou shalt have a hundrad warriors most brave in battle, most aceomplished too in feats of activitY, armed and equipped before thee if thou comest with me to the Land of Youth.

34. "Thou shalt have a protecting, well-fitting corslet, and a gold-hilted sword of most cunning stroke, worth a hundred (swords) in the hand of a true hero – its like on land thou hast never seen.

35. " Thou shalt get the royal diadem of the King of Youth that never yet was given to anyone under the sun, bright, brilliant with precious stones, whose worth cannot be put in words.

36. "Thou shalt have everything that I have said to thee, and other delight without sorrow, without weeping, thou shalt have beauty, strength, and power, and myself thou shalt have for wife ! "

37. " Refusal at all I will not give, O pleasant queen of the tresses of gold, thou art my choice beyond the women of the world, and I will go with delight to the Land of the Young ! "

38. On the steed's back we went away together, before me sat the maiden, who said " O Oisín let us go softly at first till we reach the opening into the great sea."

39. Then arose that steed with strength and when we reached the edge of the strand, he shook himself then for the journey and let forth three neighs aloud.

40. When Finn and the Fenians saw the steed swiftly (going) in his course and turning his face to the strong sea, they uttered three cries of grief.

41. " O Oisín " said Finn weak and faint, " my grief is that thou art going away, (leaving) me without a hope to see thee come back again to me all triumphant ! "

42. His features and beauty [=his beautiful features] changed and he let fall showers of tears, which drowned his bright face and bosom, and he said " My woe, O Oisín, thy going from me ! "

43. Oh Patrick, a melancholy event was our parting from each other then, the parting of the father from his own son — sad and weak am I through having to tell it.

44. I kissed my father tenderly, lovingly, and the same (mark of) affection I received from him, I bade farewell also to the Fenians, whilst the tears poured down my cheek.

45. Many a delightful day I and Finn and the Fenians with us in full glory were playing chess and carousing and listening to music — a gallant company !

46. [Or] hunting in tbe pleasant glens, our sweet-voiced hounds being with us — another time we were in the rough battle slaughtering warriors full vigorously !

47. O vain Oisín, quietly leave (treating) of thy valiant deeds amongst the Fenians — How didst thou go to the Land of the Young? Continue now for us thy story without a lie.

48. We turned our back to the land and our face directly to the west, the smooth sea ebbed hefore us, and filled in swelling waves in our rear.

49. We saw wonders on our way, — cities, courts and castles — bright palaces and fortresses, splendid sunny mansions and royal dwellings.

50. We saw also by our side a hornless doe bounding swiftly, apd a red-eared, vigorous, white hound hunting it boldly in the chase.

51. We saw also — 'tis no invention — a young maid on a brown steed (with) an apple of gold in her right hand, riding over the top of the waves.

52. We saw a short distance behind her, a young horseman on a steed most white, (dressed) in cloth of purple and red satin, with a gold-hilted sword in his right hand.

53. " Who are those two I see yonder ? O gentle queen, let me know — that woman of the beautiful countenance, and that graceful horseman on steed most white ? "

54. Take no notice of what thou shalt see O gentle Oisín, nor (mind) what thou hast yet seen, they are all as nothing till we reach in earnest the Land of the Young."

55. We saw next, away far off— a bright, sunny palace, smooth-fronted, more fair of shape and look than all else to be found in the whole world.

56. " What kingly, most bright fortress, most beautiful of all eye has seen, are we approaching now, and who is the high-prince over that fortress ? "

57. " It is the daughter of the king of the Land of the Living who is queen now in yonder fortress, whom Fovor-of-the-Blows of Druim-loghach took away with him by the great strength of his arms and (by) might.

58. " Bonds she imposed on that robber never to make her his wife, till she should find a knight or true hero who would give him battle hand to hand. "

59. "Bear sway and blessing, O gold-haired Niamh ! I have never heard any music that was better than that most sweet word from thy honeyed mouth, though great grief it is to us (to hear of) a woman of her rank being so treated.

60. " Let us go now to visit her in that fortress and it may be for me it is fated to slay that mighty warrior by feats of strength as was my custom. "

61. We went then to the fortress and there came (out) to us the young princess whose splendour was equal to the sun's, and she gave us a hundred welcomes.

62. There was a robe of yellow silk on this queen of the lovely complexion, her skin was fair as the swan upon the wave, her cheeks of the colour of the rose.

63. Of the colour of gold was her hair, and her blue eyes clear without a mist, her little mouth of honey was of the berries' hue, each slender brow was clear cut in shape.

64. We then sat down, each of us in a chair of gold — much food was placed before us, with drinking horns filled with *beoir*.

65. When we had eaten enough of food and tasted many sweet wines, the gentle young queen spoke and said " Listen to me quietly ! "

66. She told us her whole story fully and fairly and the tears fell on her cheek, and said she could never return to her own country whilst the mighty giant was alive.

67. " List, be silent, O young queen, cease from thy grief and weep not, and I swear by my hand to thee, that by me shall fall that murderous giant. "

68. " There is no hero at all to be found now— however great his repute for valour throughout the world — who would give battle hand to hand to this fierce giant — alas
me ! "

69. "I tell thee O fair queen, that not terrible to me is his coming against me, and if he fall not by the strength of my arms, then I will fall in thy defence. "

70. Not long till we saw coming the mighty giant most hateful of look, clothed in skins of deer, with a club of iron in his hand.

71. He saluted us not, nor bowed to us, but glared into the face of the young maid (his captive) declared battle and stern conflict (against me), and I went forth to encounter him.

72. For the space of three nights and three days we were (engaged) in that tough struggle, but though stout was that great giant, at last I cut his head off him.

73. When the two young maids saw the great giant lying powerless on the ground, they uttered three cries of delight with great exultation and rejoicing.

74. We then went into the castle — I was bruised, weak and faint, my blood flowing full freshly , and coming swift and hot from my wounds.

75. The daughter of the King of the Living came quickly to my relief, poured healing balm into my wounds and immediately I was well and strong.

76. We buried the big man in a grave earth-deep, wide, and clear, I raised his head-stone over his grave, and wrote his name upon it in the Ogham-of-Branches.

77. We took our meal joyfully, and merry were we then after it, and in the castle warmly-covered beds of the feathers of birds were prepared for us.

78. On its morrow at break of day we awoke from our slumber, " It is fitting for me" said the king's daughter " to set out without further rest to my own land."

79. We dressed without delay and took our leave of the maiden — grieved and mournful were we after her, and none the less was the sunny maid after us.

80. It is not known to me, O gentle Patrick, what happened that young queen (afterwards) from the day we parted from her, or even if she ever returned to the Land-of-the-Living.

81. We turned our back to the castle, with our steed under us in full course — swifter to our mind that white steed than a March wind over a mountain's ridge.

82. It was not long till the sky darkened, and the wind rose (and blew) in every direction, the great mad sea kindled terribly, but there was no glimpse to be seen of tha sun.

83. A while we were anxiously gazing at the dark clouds and on the stars that sometimes showed — when suddenly the wind and storm abated and brightly shone Phoebus above our heads.

84. We saw then at our side a most lovely land all blooming — beautiful, smooth, clear plains, and a royal castle very splendid.

85. — There was not a colour (of all) eye had seen — of bright blue, of green, and of white — of purple, of red, and of yellow — but was (to be found) in that royal palace that I am speaking of.

86. There were on the other eide of this castle, bright, sun-warmed dwellings and mansions all made of precious stones by the hands of cunning craftsmen and noble artists.

87. " What bright, lovely country is that yonder, O gentle maid of the tresses of gold — (a country) of the fairest aspect eye has ever looked upon — or is that the Land of Youth ? "

88. " It is indeed, O generous Oisín ! no untruth have I told thee about it — there is nothing of all that I have promised thee, but may be seen by thee for ever ! "

89. It was not long till we saw coming towards us from the castle to meet us thrice fiíty warriors the strongest and handsomest, and of highest fame and character.

90. There came to us after that a hundred young maids of the greatest beauty, in silken garments adorned with gold, welcoming us to their own land.

91. We saw next coming forth a band of the very choicest troops, and an illustrious, powerful, mighty king, best in figure, features, and complexion.

92. A yellow shirt of the smoothest silk (was) on him, and over it a bright cloak adorned with gold — and on his head a glittering crown of gold, shining and brilliant.

93. We saw coming next the young queen of the highest fame, and fifty maidens sweet-voiced, modest, of the fairest form, in her train.

94. When they had all come into one place thus kindly spoke the King of Youth and said — " Here is Oisín the son of Finn, the chosen spouse of Gold-haired Niamh ! "

95. He seized me then by the hand and said loud enough for the whole host " O valiant Oisín O son of the king, a hundred thousand weleomes to thee !

96. " This land in which thou hast arrived — its virtues I will not hide from thee, truly long and lasting shail thy life he, and thou shalt be young for ever.

97. " There is no delight of all the heart has ever imagined that is not in this country for thee, — thou mayest O Oisín truly believe me, for I am King of the Land of Youth ! "

98. " Here is our fair queen, and here our daughter Niamh the Golden-haired, who crossed the smooth sea for thee, to have thee for her husband for ever! "

99. I gave thanks to the king and bowed low to the virtuous queen ; we did not delay longer there but entered the Palace of the King of Youth.

100. (Then) came the nobles of that fair city both men and women to greet us — there was feasting and festivity there continuously for the space of ten nights and ten days.

101. I was married (then) to Gold-haired Niamh — O Patrick from Rome, of the white croziers, — thus was it I went to the Land of Youth, though sad and sorrowful for me to treat of it.

102. Continue thy story further, O Oisín of the golden words, O Oisín of the warlike arms, how didst thou leave the Land of Youth ? I feel it long till thou revealest the reason.

103. Tell me too with great kindness hadst thou any children by Niamh, or wast thou long in the Land of tlie Young ? Tell us the story now without grieving.

104. I had by Gold-haired Niamh children of the fairest complexion and greatest beauty — best featured, best shaped, brightest hued — two young sons and one fair daughter.

105. O pleasant Oisín, continue thy story and tell me where thy children are, tell me their names without delay, and the country they are (now) living in.

106. Niamh held for them the Land-of-Youth, the Land-of-the-Living, and the Land-of-Virtues, a rod of lordship [sceptre] and crown of kingly gold and a wealth of gems I do not mention.

107. Gold-haired Niamh gave to my two boys the names of my father and my well-beloved son — Finn the illustrious and victorious, and head of the hosts — and golden Oscar of the deadly weapons.

108. I myself gave to my fair daughter with the consent of most lovable Niamh, in virtue of her beauty and great sweetness the true name — Flower-of-women.

109. I spent (there) a long-lasting period — three hundred years apparently and more — till (at length) I thought within myself I should like to see (once more) Finn and the Fenians alive.

110. One day I asked leave of the king and of my gentle wife, Golden-haired Niamh, to go back to Erin again to see my father Finn and his great host

111. " Thou shalt get leave, " said the lovely woman, "though woeful the subject thou hast broached — for I fear thou wilt never come back again duilng thy lifetime, to my own land, my Oisín of victory ! "

112. "What cause for fear have we, O sunny queen, when the white steed shall be at my will ? He will easily ahow me the qay, and I shall return to thee safe ! "

113. " Remember, O Oisín, what I am saying — if thou layest foot to smooth ground there is no return for thee ever again to this lovely land where I am !

114. " I tell thee again without falsehood, if thou alightest from the white steed, thou shalt never come (again) to the Land of Youth — O golden Oisín of the victorious arms ! "

115. " For the third time I say to thee, shouldst thou come off thy horse, that thou wilt be a blind, withered old man, without strength or spirit, unable to run or bound !

116. "I think it woeful, dear Oisín, that thou shouldst ever go to green Erin again, she is not now as she was (of old) and thou never shalt see Finn of the hosts !

117. " Thou wilt not find now in Erin eastward (any) but fathers of orders and troops of saints — then beloved Oisín, here is my kiss to thee — to the Land of Youth, woe, woe ! I fear thou never wilt return ! "

118. I looked with sorrow into her face, and a shower of tears fell from my eyes — O stern Patrick, even thou wouldst have pitied her, to see her tearing the tresses of her soft, golden hair ! "

119. She put me under strict bonds to go and come without touching ground, and told me, that such was their power, if I should break them, I should not return safe.

120. I promised her everything faithfully — that I would do all she told me — I mounted the back of the white steed, and bade fareweil to the people of the castle.

121. I kissed my gentle wife, and melancholy were we at the parting — (I kissed also) my two sons and young daughter, who were in grief shedding tears.

122. I then prepared myself for the journey and turned my back to the Land of Youth — swiftly the horse rushed away with me, as he had done (before) with me and Goldhaired Niamh.

123. O Patrick of the orders and of the saints, a falsehood I have never yet told thee — there is now for thee the substance of my story and how I left the Land of Youth.

124. If I could get abundance of bread, as I used to get at all times from Finn, I would pray to the King of Graces that thou mightst be saved for ever on account of it.

125. Thou shalt have food and drink ail unstinted now from me — sweet to me the words of thy lips — continue thy story still for me.

126. Our tale is not told minutely about everything that happened to me — till I came back again to green Erin of the many gems.

127. On (my) coming then to land I gazed minutely in every direction — and then I began to fear really that no tidings could be found of Finn.

128. Not long and no great while was I (standing) till I saw coming towards me up from the west a great cavalcade of men and women, and they came up to me.

129. They greeted me kindly and sweetly and wonder seized each one of them, on seeing the size of my body, my figure, my look, and my countenance.

130. I inquired then of them if they had heard that Finn was alive, or if any one else of the Fenians still lived — or what calamity had happened to them.

131. " We have heard (men) treat of Finn, for strength, activity and valour — that there never was his equal in person, in mind, in fame.

132. " Many a book is there to be found amongst the sweet, melodious bards of the Gael, of which we could not easily tell thee — that speaks of the deeds of Finn and the Fenians.

133. " We have heard that Finn had a son of distinguished beauty and form, that a young maid came hither for him, and that he went away with her to the Land of Youth."

134. When I heard that speech — that neither Finn nor one of the Fenians (now) lived — a faintness and great grief seized me, and full gloomy was I after them.

135. I did not stop then in my course, but forthwith I went away swiftly, rapidly, and turned my face straight, direct to renowned Alvin of broad Leinster.

136. Great was my amazement then that I could not see the court of Finn of the hosts — there was nothing in its place truly, but weeds, chickweed and nettles.

137. Alas, O Patrick, and alas, my woe ! an empty (useless) visit was it for me, with no tidings (whatever) to be got of Finn or of the Fenians ! 'tis that has left me in sorrow for (the rest of) my days !

138. I will follow up the story for thee, O Patrick — after I had left Alvin of Leinster, there was no dwelling-place in which the Fiann had ever lived that I did not visit eagerly and anxiously.

139. In passing through Glenasmole I saw a great gathering there — three hundred men and more were before me in that glen.

140. One of the herd then spoke to me, and said with loud voice " Come to our assistance O kingly hero, and release us from this dire difficulty ! "

141. I then came up to the spot, and there the crowd were labouring under a great flag of marble — the weight of the flag was bearing down upon them and to cast it away from them they had no power.

142. Some of them who were down under the flag were being miserably crushed — with the distressing weight of the great load many of them lost their senses.

143. Then one of the stewards spoke and said : " O youthful kingly champion, relieve at once our men, or a man of them at all shall not iive ! "

144. " It is a shameful word now to say — seeing the number of men there are here — that they could not with the entire strength of the crowd lift that stone full stoutly !

145. "If Oscar son of Oisín lived he would seize that stone in his right hand, he would send it with a cast over (the heads of) this crowd — no falsehood am I accustomed to speak ! "

146. I leaned to my right side and seized the flag in one hand — with the strength and vigour of my arms I cast it seven perches írom that spot !

147. With the exertion of hurling that very great flag the golden girth of the white steed broke — full swiftly I came to the ground on the soles of my two feet !

148. No sooner had I come down than fear seized the white steed — he ran off then away, and I in grief (left) weak and helpless

149. I lost the sight of my eyes, my figure, my (fair) countenance, and my bloom — (and) I was a poor, blind old man, powerless^ witless, unhonoured !

150. O Patrick, there is for thee my story — as (everything) happened to me without any falsehood — my going away, my adventures in full, and my return from the Land of the Young !

As well as providing his own translations, 
Flannery also reviewed several other versions.

For example, he remarked on the first popular translation of the poem:

> But not till 1859 was this fine poem printed — so difficult was it to get anything published in the Irish language. In tnat year it was at length brought before the public by Mr. Brian O'Looney who edited it — with an interesting introduction — for the *Irish Ossianic Society*, and on the version given by him in the fourth volume of that Society's *Transactions*, the present edition is mainly based. But during the hundred years of its unprinted existence, the poem could not fail to be altered, added to, and corrupted. Some of the versions current in the neighbouring counties of Galway and Mayo for instance differ considerably from the first printed edition — some are much longer, some shorter, some worse, a few in some respects better.

Flannery also reviewed other translations that had appeared since the original publication of the poem (which is to say, between 1859 and 1896):

> Since 1859 its attractiveness has made it a frequent theme for writers. Mr. O'Looney only gave a literal prose translation of his version ; it was followed in 1860 (or '61) by a metrical translation by 'A Member of the Ossianic Society' which was published by the late John O'Daly — but it was a most unworthy representation of the Irish poem. Next came Mr. T. D. Sullivan's very pleasing English poetical version — but it was more a *paraphrase* than a *translation*, did not give the whole story, and did not attempt the style or metre of the original. Mr. David Comyn — a namesake, and I believe a scion of the family of the original author, republished the Irish poem in 1880 for the Gaelic Union — keeping too closely however both to Mr. O'Looney's text and to his translation. But Mr. Comyn only gave a literal translation of the poem, accompanying it certainly with a very useful vocabulary. Now to translate a poem merely word for word, is I hold nothing less than *desecration* — it is treating it as a mere heap of words, or as a column of a dictionary — ignoring its chief value, namely, as *a piece of literature*. In his "Old Celtic Romances," Dr. Joyce gives a very readable but very brief prose summary of the story in English, and recently Mr. W. B. Yeats has published a poem called "The Wanderings of Ossian," but how far this is a translation of *Tír na nÓg* , I cannot say, as I have not seen it.

Tír Na Nóg — The Land of Youth

> The Council of the Ossianic Society do not hold them- ' selves responsible for the authenticity or antiquity of the following poem ; but print it as an interesting specimen of the most recent of the Fenian Stories. In the tract which follows it will be found one of the most ancient of the re- cords that describe the exploits of Finn Mac Gumhaill.

TO
WILLIAM SMITH O'BRIEN, ESQ.,
PRESIDENT OF THE OSSIANIC SOCIETY.

Sir,— Pursuant to your wishes, and at your very kind suggestion, I have undertaken the following translation of the Ossianic poem, on Cfti i)A ij-65 (" Land of Youth,") in the humble but confident hope that I may, however, unpretending as an Irish scholar, be in some measure instrumental in restoring our neglected lore to its former style and standard.

From my knowledge of the Fenian stories, and Ossianic poems which circulate in this country, I would classify them under three different and distinct heads, 1st, Fenian history, which comprises all based upon fact aand supported by the ancient records and chronicles of our country, such as Cac 5A5ttA, Caz Cquca and the like, which it would be absurd to discredit against the forcible evidence of our trustworthy annals. 2nd, inventions and poetic Actions which are entertaining, and intended by the authors more to amuse the reader and to embellish history, than, as some say, to impose on his understanding, and claim the credit of truth. 3rd, the poems and prophecies of f 101717, Coftt]oU, CAO^lce, and others of the flAiyi)^ 6}ftiooi9 (Irish Militia), which are very interesting, and I should think entitled to as much credit as the early traditions of any other nation.

Some assume that the genuine old poems and stories cannot be distinguished from the modern Actions, and consequently that they cannot be credited, but that all must be considered worthless. This is a very unjustifiable assumption. The Irish scholar will at once know the composition of the Fenian period, as the language and style is different from that of latter times. From the fourteenth to the beginning of the eighteenth century, we bare another dais of poems and romantic tales, which exhibit a later stage of the language, but which are well worthy of attention. My own convlcton is that the Ossianic poem on the " Land of Youth" is of this last class and date, and from the testimony of many corroborating facts supported by the result of an inquiry which I instituted at your suggestion, I believe it to have been written by the learned Michael Comyn, contemporaneously with the romance of CotiolbtiiAc 5cAnti7» ie. (Toroly the son of Stam), about the year A.D. 1749. By comparing Cf tt v^ 19-05 with the occasionally interspersed verses in the romance of Torolr the son of Stam, Sec, whose author is universally acknowledged to be Michael Comyc, it will be perceived that there is such a similarity and almost identity of style in them as to leave no doubt that they are both the productions of the same master mind. As further proof of this I may state that an illiterate man of my acquaintance can repeat several verses of it, but knows it under no other name but that of lAO| Aif CojiqfDis (Comyn's Lay) and that his father had it from Comyn's manuscript. Another man states in a letter to me, that his copy of it was written in the year 1762 by a celebrated Irish scholar, who lived in Ruan, County of Glare. In this poem we have an account of Cf n 9A fh^Aome itfAjt^ (Land of the good people), the elysium of the Pagan Irish as related to St. Patrick by Oisin, when he returned to Erin after a lapse of more than three hundred years, which he spent in the enjoyment of all bliss, with his charming spouse, the golden headed (haired) Niamh. While Oisin sojourned in the paradise of perpetual youth, it was (it seems falsely) said of him that he was dead, but as those who enter the " Land of the Just" can never die, so Oisin lived until he returned to relate the history of his adventures, and of this happy elysium. The inhabitants, of the eastern countries believed that in the west there was a happy final abode for the just which was called Cfti qa v-bAoi^e m^fce (Land of the good people.)

This elysium is supposed to be divided into different states and provinces, each governed by its own king or ruler, such asCfn i^a 9-65 (Land of youth) Cfn 9A ii>.beo (Land of the Living) C|ft i|a i9-bttA6A (Land of virtues) and several others. According to traditional geography and history the "Land of Youth" is the most charming country to be found or imagined, abounding in all that fancy could suggest or man could desire, and bestowing the peculiar virtue of perpetual youth, and hence the name. In the " Land of Virtues," or as some call it, the "Land of Victories" (but the latter name I suppose to be a mis-translation, as I have never heard of a battle or strife in this country); it is all peace, tranquility and happiness. As there is no conflict there can be no victory— and there is no virtue to be desired which is not to be had on entering this country ! The " Land of life" is supposed to give perpetual life to the departed spirits of the just. These are supposed to be located somewhere about the sun's setting point, and have means of approach, chiefly through the seas, lakes and rivers of this world, also through raths, duns and forts. The seas, lakes and riyers act as cooling atmospheres, while the raths, duns and forts, serve as places of ingress and egress to and from them. There are besides, different grand-gates, as it were, through, out the world, such asQU ScuinQ (Kill Stuifin), situate in liscannor Bey, supposed to be one of the chief entrances into Cftt v^ 17-05 (" Land of youth.") This is said to be abeautiftil but small city, marked by the white breaking waves between Iaacc (Lahinch.) and lTor-CeAi)i7i&in (Liscannor). The white breaking wares, which are always seen in this part of the Bay, are said to be caused by the shallowness of the water over this enchanted little city, which is beliered to be seen once in seven years, and of which, it is observed, that those who see it shall depart this world before the lapse of seven years to come ; but it is not supposed that those persons die but change their abode, and transmigrate from this world of toil, into the elysium of the just, t,e, Cfn da i)-65 (** Land of Youth,") where they shall, at once, become sportive, young and happy, and continue so for ever. It is also believed, that those who see those enchanted spots, are slightly endowed with the gift of prophecy, from the time they see it till they depart this world, and that they pass through this enchanted passage, so magically shewn them, prior to their departure. For further information on C|U 5cu|F|9 (Kill Stuifin), read Comyn's Romance, called Qacz^a totto]lb n^Aic ScAttto A5Ar a cttiutt 19 ac (the adventures of Torolv Mac Starn and his three sons). Contiguous to this place is another spot called C90C oa nos^^e (Fairy Hill), this was the ancient name of Lahinch, before the death of the Chieftain, O'Connor of Dumhach, (the Sand pits), who had been treacherously slain there, and in memory of whom there had been raised a monument called leAcc uj Coq- cubATft (0*Connor*s monument), which in Irish is the present name of this little town, but in its anglicised form Lahinch, or Lahinchy, it has lost all sight of the old derivation. It was called Cooc pA 5105x60 (Fairy Hill), from its being the meeting place of the fairy nobles of this section of the country, who, it seems, lived on terms of intercourse with the nobles of Cffi 17A 0-65 ("Land of Youth,") and this hill is traditionally believed to be the place where both tribes met and held their periodical conferences. The nobles of this country are said to live in the great and large duns, fortresses, lisses, and raths, and to act as agents to the nobles of Cfft 17A 9.65 (" Land of Youth,") and to those of all the states of the lower paradise. One of the duties of their station is to mark the persons suitable to the lower country, and by their supernatural power they meet or send messengers to carry off those persons. It is in the shape of a beautiful lady, such as HrAib Cwt) Of ft, golden-headed, (haired) Niamh, that this messenger is generally seen. After the human creature whom she has visited has seen her, she vanishes in some magic way, and goes back to her own country. Ere long the person visited will pine away by some formal disease, and will be said to die, but fairy tradition proves that he or she (whichever it may be), does not die, but that they go into this elysium, where they will become young again and live for ever.

There are several such passages in this country, to describe which, would be both needless and endless. Suffice it to mention a few of the greatest celebrity— 16 or fb bfteAfAl (0*Breasail*s country), lb lefcfij, (0*Leihin's country), Inchiquin and Lough Gur. The great Earl of Desmond is supposed to have been submerged in the latter, where he is seen once in every seven years, anxiously awaiting the destined hour of return to his country. On reference to the ancient records and Pagan history of different nations, it will be seen that they have their traditions of Pagan elysiums as well as Ireland.

> Sir,  
> There is a similar legend to that related in the following poem told of Oisin's descent, and living for three hundred years in UAftb ija Caojiac 5lAffe (the cavern of the grey sheep), a large cave which is situated at C'oolagarronroe, Kilbenny, near Mitchelstown, in the county of Cork. After the printing of this poem had been decided upon, I wrote to Mr. William Williams of Dungarvan, who is a native of the district, for in- formation respecting any legendary lore connected with this cave, from whom I received the following answer, as being current among the peasantry.
>
> J. O'D.

__LEGEND OF THE GREY SHEEP'S CAVE AT COOLAGAR-BONROE, NEAR KILBENNY.__

" Oisin went into the cave, met a beautiful damsel, after crossing the stream, lived with her for (as he fancied) a few days, wished to revisit the Fenians, obtained consent at last, on condition of not alighting from the white steed with which she furnished him, stating that it was over 300 years since he came to the cave. He proceeded till he met a carrier, whose cart, containing a bag of sand, was upset ; he asked Oisin to help him ; unable to raise the bag with one hand, he alighted, on which the steed fled, leaving him a *withered, decrepid, blind old man*."

" On a certain May morning long ago, a grey sheep was seen to come out of the cave, and to go to a neighbouring farmer's field, where she remained, until herself and her breed amounted to sixty grey sheep.

" The boy who took care of the sheep, was a widow's only son, a disciple of Pan ; for he played on the bag-pipes.

" His master, the farmer, ordered him one fine day to kill one of the sheep, he proceeded to the field for that purpose ; but the old sheep knowing his intention, and resolving to frustrate it, bleated three times, which instantly brought all the other black sheep around her, when they disappeared altogether into the cave. The boy followed them but having crossed the *enchanted stream* which runs through the cave, he was unable to return ; as no one ever re-crosscd it but Oisin. On reflecting on the anguish his loss and absence would cause his mother, he raised a mournful strain which he accompanied by the music of his bag-pipes. On every May day from that day to this, the lamentations of the boy, and the music of his pipes are heard in the cave."
