# Tales Told

In this section, I will attempt to keep a record of the order in which I 
originally told the tales, or first heard them having embarked upon this journey.

Order in which I first told each tale, along with notes:

- *Oisín and Tír na nÓg*, Waverley folk night, 2022-??-??: telling this first provides an entry point into how the tales came to be recorded, eg via St Patrick, as well as anchoring the tales to the Other World. We are introduced to Finn as the father of Oisín, and the Fianna as a band of warriors that Oisín was a part of. We also have a natural path to the preceding battle of Gavra and the loss of Oisín's son, Oscar. In passing, we might note a similarity to the tale of Thomas the Rhymer.

- *The Birth of Oisín*, Waverley folk night, 2022-??-??: an onomastic tale that explains Oisín's name, this followed on from the previous story I'd told previously at the Waverley. Oisín's heritage perhaps also helps explain how he came to be known in that other place. Finn is introduced by proxy, as are his two favourite dogs, Bran and Sceolan. We can introduce the idea of the Fianna as warriors who hunted on foot, rather than on horseback, with packs of dogs.

- *Woodland Cottage: Fianna Heroes meet Strength/Death/Youth, by Way of Diarmuid's Love Spot*, Waverley folk night, 2022-08-03: I had intended to tell of Fionn's childhood and the salmon of knowledge, but after hearing the tale of cottage encountered by Conan, Cuilthe, Diarmuid and Goll mac Morna (I kept forgetting Goll's name) and their meeting with the strength of the world (goat), death (cat) and youth (fair maiden), as told by Kate Corkery at FATE a couple of weeks previously, I was moved to tell that. It further establishes fairy credentials, but also serves to introduce four key characters in the Fianna. I messed up by sating Conan was "a warrior's warrior": that really should have been "was *not* a warrrior's warrior", because he his characterised more as a coward.
