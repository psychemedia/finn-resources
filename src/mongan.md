"Once upon a time Fiacna Finn, son of Baedan, son of Muirchertach, son of Muredach, son of Eoghan, son of Niall, went forth from Ireland until he came to the Lochlanns." This is a copy — the only known copy — of the life of Mongan, son of Fiachna, King of XJlidia in the sixth century. It is mentioned in the list of ancient tales published by Mr. O'Curry,* from the "Book of Leinster," under the title of 66cpa TTlonsain mic piacbna, "Adventures of Mongan, son of Fiachna." The first part of the tract is occupied by the adventures of Fiachna, Mongan's father, who in his youth had visited the country of the Loclilanns, or Scandinavia, where Eolgharg Mor, son of Maghar, was then king, and lying ill of a fatal disease. The physicians declared that nothing could cure him but the flesh of a perfectly white cow, with red ears; after searching the whole country, only one such cow was found, the property of an old woman, f whose sole possession it was. She agreed to accept four of the best cows in exchange for her own, provided the Irish prince Fiachna became security for the performance of the promise. To this the king's steward induced Fiachna to agree; but soon after, the death of his father compelled him to return with haste to Ireland, to take possession of his inheritance as King of XJlidia. He had been scarcely settled on his throne when the old woman appeared before him, .

Celtic mythology
by MacCulloch, J. A. (John Arnott), 1868-1950

Publication date 1918

p59

A folk-tale analogy to this myth occurs in a West Irish collection. Two heroes at enmity fought until they were old men, then as puppies until they were old dogs, then as young bulls, as stallions, and as birds, until one was slain, his body falling on the other and killing him. The rebirth incident is lacking here."

In the story which narrates how King Mongan recovered his wife from the King of Leinster his feats were originally those of a divine namesake. Taking the form of a cleric, he gave that of another cleric to his attendant and won entrance to the King's fort and to his wife. He kissed her, but when the attendant hag cried out, he sent a magic breath at her, and what ^e had seen was no longer clear in her mind, after which he shaped a sharp spike on which she fell and was killed. His attempt to recover his wife failed, however, and at a later time he took the guise of Aed, son of the King of Connaught, transforming a hag into the shape of Aed's beautiful wife, IbhelL The King of Leinster fell in love with her.and exchanged Mongan's wife to the pretended Aed for her; but the pair escaped, and great was the King's disgust to find Ibhell in the form of a hag. Mongan also made a river with a bridge over it, where none had ever been before, and in it he set the two clerics whose shapes he had borrowed."

GODS HELPING MORTALS

IN Greek mythology the gods were represented as coming to man's help, and in Christian legend saints were seen hovering above an army in battle and giving it substantial aid. So in Celtic myth deities were often kindly disposed toward men or assisted them, sometimes for ends of their own.

Such a myth is associated with the historic King Mongan of Ulster in the sixth and seventh centuries. He is shown to be son of the god Manannan by a mortal mother, and as has been seen, he had powers of shape-shifting, and besides being brought up in the divine land, had free access to it. He was also regarded as a rebirth of the hero Fionn; hence the stories told of this king of the Christian historic period must already have been narrated of some far earlier mythic king or god, perhaps possessed of the same name. Two of these legends narrate how the god assisted Mongan's putative father out of desire for his wife. In the shorter story Fiachna, King of Ulster, had gone to help Aedan in Scotland against Saxon hosts who had with them a terrible warrior, and during the fight a noble stranger appeared to Fiachna's wife and asked her love. She refused him with scorn, but later relented in order to save her husband's life, which, said the visitant, was in danger from the terrible warrior. "Our son will be famous, and his name will be Mongan. I shall tell thy husband our adventures, and that thou didst send me to his help." This the stranger did, afterward slaying the warrior and giving victory to Fiachna; and when Mongan was bom, he was known as Manannan's son, for Manannan had announced his name when leaving the Queen at dawn.^

n the longer version Fiachna had become security for the exchange of four kine offered by the King of Lochlann to a Black Hag for her cow, the flesh of which alone could cure his disease. Later the hag compelled Fiachna to fight with the Eang, who had broken his promise to her; but all went well until the King of Lochlann let lOose venomous sheep, before which Fiachna's men fell in hundreds. A warrior in a green cloak fastened by a silver brooch, with a circlet of gold on his head and golden sandals on his feet, appeared and asked what reward Fiachna would give him who would drive off the sheep. Fiachna replied that he would give anything he had, whereupon the warrior begged his ring "as a token for me when I go to Ireland to thy wife to sleep with her," to which the complacent Fiachna assented. The stranger — Manannan — announced that he would beget a glorious child, called Mongan Finn, or the "Fair"; "and I shall go there in thy shape, so that thy wife shall not be defiled by it." Fiachna would also become King of Lochlann. Taking a venomous hound from his cloak, Manannan launched it successfully at the sheep and then appeared to the Queen as Fiachna. On the night of Mongan's birth the Queen's attendant had a son, Mac an Daimh, while the wife of Fiachna's opponent, Fiachna the Black, bore a daughter, Dubh Lacha, these possibly also being children of the amorous god. When Mongan was three days old, Manannan took him to the Land of Promise and brought him back when he was sixteen. Meanwhile Fiachna Dub having killed the other Fiachna, the Ulstermen bargained that Mongan should retain half the province, with Dubh Lacha as his wife. One day when he and his Queen were playing together, "a dark, black-tufted little cleric" reproached Mongan for his inactivity and offered to help him to regain his land. Mongan went with him; they slew Fiachna; and all Ulster became Mongan's. The cleric was Manannan, though his transformation, in this as in the other version, is the result of the revision of the story by a Christian scribe. At a later time Mongan

exchanged Dubh Lacha for the kine of the King of Leinster, but she, while living in the King's house, persuaded him to wait a year ere she was his.* How Mongan regained her through his magic powers learned in the divine land has already been described. A prophecy about Mongan is put into Manannan's mouth in The Voyage of Bratiy where he tells Bran how he will go to Fiachna's Queen, that by her he will have a son who will delight the folk of the sidy will make known secrets and take all forms — dragon, wolf, stag, salmon, seal — and how the god will place the valiant hero with princes and will be his tutor.

These are the events that brought about the tellinng of "Mongan's Frenzy."

rindtigemd,^ Mongan's wife, besought Mongin to tell her the simple truth of his adventures. He asked of her a respite of seven years. It was granted. Then that period arrived. The 15 men of Ireland had a great gathering at Usnech in Meath, the year of the death of Ciardn the son of the Carpenter, and of the slaying of Tiiathal Maelgarb,^ and of the taking of the kingship by Diarmait.* The hosts were on (the hill of) Usnech. A great hail-storm came upon them there. Such was its great- 20 ness that the one shower left twelve chief streams in Ireland for ever. Mongin with seven men arose and went from the cairn aside, and his queen and his shanachie Cairthide, son of Marcdn. Then they saw something, a prominent stronghold

[The Conception of Mongan and Dub-Lacha's Love for Mongdn.]

25 I. Once upon a time Fiachna Finn, son of Baetdn, son of Murchertach, son of Muredach, son of Eogan, son of Niall, went forth from Ireland, until he came to Lochlann, over which Eolgarg Mor, son of Magar, was at that time king. There he found great respect and love and honour. And he


APPENDIX 71

was not long there, when a disease seized the king of Lochlann, who asked of his leeches and physicians what would help him. And they told him there was in the world nothing that would help him, save a red-eared shining-white cow, which was to be boiled for him. And the people of Loch- 5 lann searched for the cow, and there was found the single cow of Caillech Dub (Black Hag). Another cow was offered to her in its stead, but the hag refused. Then four were offered to her, viz., one cow for every foot, and the hag would not accept any other condition but that Fiachna should be- 10 come security. Now this was the hour and the time that messengers came for Fiachna Finn, the son of Baetdn, and he went with those messengers, and took the kingship of Ulster, and was king for one year.

2. One day at the end of a year he heard cries of distress in 15 front of the fort, and he told (his men) to go and see who made those cries, and to let the person that made them into the house. And there was the hag from Lochlann come to demand her security. Fiachna knew her and bade her welcome and asked tidings of her. 'Evil tidings I have,' said the hag. 'The king 20 of Lochlann has deceived me in the matter of the four kine that were promised to me for my cow.' 'I will give thee four kine on his behalf, O hag,' said Fiachna. But the hag said she would not take them. 'I will give twenty kine on his behalf,' said Fiachna. 'I shall not take them,' said the hag. 'I will give 25 four times twenty kine,' said Fiachna, 'twenty kine for each cow.' 'By my word,' said the hag, 'if all the kine of the province of Ulster were given to me, I should not take them, until thou come thyself to make war upon the king of Lochlann. As I have come to thee from the east, so do thou come on 3° a journey with me.'

3. Then Fiachna assembled the nobles of Ulster until he had ten equally large battalions, and went and announced battle to the men of Lochlann. And they were three days a-gathering unto the battle. And combat was made by the king of Loch- 35 lann on the men of Ireland. And three hundred warriors fell

by Fiachna in the fight. And venomous sheep were let out of the king of Lochlann's tent against them, and on that day three hundred warriors fell by the sheep, and three hundred warriors fell on the second day, and three hundred on the third

5 day. That was grievous to Fiachna, and he said: 'Sad is the journey on which we have come, for the purpose of having our people killed by the sheep. For if they had fallen in battle or in combat by the host of Lochlann, we should not deem their fall a disgrace, for they would avenge themselves. Give me,' saith

10 he, ' my arms and my dress that I may myself go to fight against the sheep.' 'Do not say that, O King,' said they, ' for it is not meet that thou shouldst go to fight against them.' 'By my word,' said Fiachna, 'no more of the men of Ireland shall fall by them, till I myself go to fight against the sheep; and if I

15 am destined to find death there, I shall find it, for it is impossible to avoid fate; and if not, the sheep will fall by me.'

4. As they were thus conversing, they saw a single tall warlike man coming towards them. He wore a green cloak of one

20 colour, and a brooch of white silver in the cloak over his breast, and a satin shirt next his white skin. A circlet of gold around his hair, and two sandals of gold under his feet. And the warrior said: 'What reward wouldst thou give to him who would keep the sheep from thee? ' 'By my word,' said Fiachna, ' [whatever

25 thou ask], provided I have it, I should give it.' 'Thou shalt have it (to give),' said the warrior, 'and I will tell thee the reward.' 'Say the sentence,' said Fiachna. ' I shall say it,' said he; 'give me that ring of gold on thy finger as a token for me, when I go to Ireland to thy wife to sleep with her.' 'By my word,'

30 said Fiachna, ' I would not let one man of the men of Ireland fall on account of that condition.' 'It shall be none the worse for thee; for a glorious child shall be begotten by me there, and from thee he shall be named, even Mongan the Fr ir (Finn), son of Fiachna the Fair. And I shall go there in thy shape, so

35 that thy wife shall not be defiled by it. And I am Manannan, son of Ler, and thou shalt seize the kingship of Lochlann and of


APPENDIX 73

the Saxons and Britons.' Then the warrior took a venomous hound ^ out of his cloak, and a chain upon it, and said: 'By my word, not a single sheep shall carry its head from her to the fortress of the king of Lochlann, and she will kill three hundred of the hosts of Lochlann, and thou shalt have what will come of 5 it.' The warrior went to Ireland, and in the shape of Fiachna himself he slept with Fiachna's wife, and in that night she became pregnant. On that day the sheep and three hundred of the nobles of Lochlann fell by the dog, and Fiachna seized the kingship of Lochlann and of the Saxons and Britons. 10

5. Now, as to the Cailleach Dubh, Fiachna gave her her due, viz., seven castles with their territory and land, and a hundred of every cattle. And then he went into Ireland and found his wife big-bellied and pregnant, and when her time came, she bore a son. Now Fiachna the Fair had an attendant, whose 15 name was An Damh, and in that (same) night his wife brought forth a son, and they were christened together, and the son of Fiachna was named Mongan, and the son of the attendant was named Mac an Daimh. And there was another warrior reigning together with Fiachna the Fair, to wit Fiachna the Black, 20 son of Deman,^ who lay heavily on his^ rule. And to him in the same night a daughter was bom, to whom the name DubhLacha (Black Duck) White-hand was given, and Mongan and Dubh-Lacha were affianced to each other. When Mongan was three nights old, Manannan came for him and took him 25 with him to bring him up in the Land of Promise, and vowed that he would not let him back into Ireland before he were twelve years of age.

6. Now as to Fiachna the Black, son of Deman, he watched his opportunity, and when he found that Fiachna the Fair, son 30 of Baedan, had with him but a small host and force, he went up

to his stronghold, and burnt and destroyed it, and killed

^ brot-chii, perhaps a mastifif. See Glossary.

^ He was ruler of the Dal Fiatach. See the Four Masters, A.D. 597 and 622. ' i.e. Fiachna Finn's

Fiachna himself, and seized the kingship of Ulster by force.^ And all the men of Ulster desired Mongan to be brought to them when he was six years old, but Manannan did not bring him to Ulster till he had completed sixteen years. And then 5 he came to Ulster, and the men of Ulster made peace between themselves and Fiachna the Black, to wit, one-half of Ulster to Mongan, and Dubh-Lacha to be his wife and consort in retaliation for his father. And it was done so.

7. One day while Mongan and his wife were ^^Xz.y'va.g fidchell, 10 they saw a dark black-tufted little cleric at the door-post, who

said: 'This inactivity ^ in which thou art, O Mongan, is not an inactivity becoming a king of Ulster, not to go to avenge thy father on Fiachna the Black, son of Deman, though DubhLacha may think it wrong to tell thee so. For he has now but

15 a small host and force with him; and come with me thither, and let us burn the fortress, and let us kill Fiachna.' 'There is no knowing what luck ^ there may be on that saying, O cleric,' said Mongan, ' and we shall go with thee.' And thus it was done, for Fiachna the Black was killed by them.* Mongan seized

20 the kingship of Ulster, and the little cleric who had done the treason was Manannan the great and mighty.

8. And the nobles of Ulster were gathered to Mongan, and he said to them: 'I desire to go to seek boons ^ from the provincial kings of Ireland, that I may get gold and silver and

25 wealth to give away.' 'That is a good plan,' said they. And he went forth into the provinces of Ireland, until he came to Leinster. And the king of Leinster at that time was Brandubh

mac Echach. And he gave a hearty welcome to the king of Ulster, and they slept that night in the place, and when Mongan awoke on the morrow, he saw the fifty white red-eared kine, and a white calf by the side of each cow, and as soon as he saw them he was in love with them. And the king of 5 Leinster observed him and said to him: 'Thou art in love with the kine, O king,' saith he. 'By my word,' said Mongan, 'save the kingdom of Ulster, I never saw anything that I would rather have than them.' 'By my word,' said the king of Leinster, 'they are a match for Dubh-Lacha, for she is the one 10 woman that is most beautiful in Ireland, and those kine are the most beautiful cattle in Ireland, and on no condition in the world would I give them except on our making friendship without refusal.'

9. They did so, and each bound the other. And Mongan 15 went home and took his thrice (sic) fifty white kine with him. And Dubh-Lacha asked: 'What are the cattle that are the most beautiful that I ever saw? and he who got them,' saith she, '. . . , for no man got them except for . . . .' And Mongan told her how he had obtained the kine. And they 20 were not long there when they saw hosts approaching the place, and 'tis he that was there, even the king of Leinster. 'What hast thou come to seek?' said Mongan. ' For, by my word, if what thou seekest be in the province of Ulster, thou shalt have it.' 'It is, then,' said the king of Leinster. 'To seek Dubh- 25 Lacha have I come.'

10. Silence fell upon Mongan. And he said: 'I have never heard of any one giving away his wife.' 'Though thou hast not heard of it,' said Dubh-Lacha, 'give her, for honour is more lasting than life.' Anger seized Mongan, and he allowed the king of 30 Leinster to take her with him. Dubh-Lacha called the king of Leinster aside and said to him: 'Dost thou know, O king of Leinster, that the men and one half of Ulster would fall for my sake, except I had already given love to thee? And by my word!

I shall not go with thee until thou grant me the sentence of my 35 own lips.' 'What is the sentence?' said the king of Leinster.

'Thy word to fulfil it!' saith she. The king of Leinster gave his word, with the exception of his being left . . .1 ' Then, said Dubh-Lacha, 'I desire that until the end of one year we be not brought for one night into the same house, and if in the 5 course of a day thou comest into the same house with me, that thou shouldst not sit in the same chair with me, but sit in a chair over against me, for I fear the exceeding great love which I have bestowed upon thee, that thou mayst hate me, and that I may not again be acceptable to my own husband; for if we 10 are a-courting each other during this coming year, our love will not recede.'

11. And the king of Leinster granted her that condition, and he took her to his house, and there she was for a while. And for that while Mongan was in a wasting sickness con-

1 5 tinually. And in the night in which Mongan had taken Dubh-Lacha, Mac an Daimh had taken her foster-sister, who was her trusty attendant, and who had gone into Leinster with Dubh-Lacha. So one day Mac an Daimh came into the house where Mongan was, and said: 'Things are in a

20 bad way with thee,^ O Mongan,' saith he, 'and evil was thy journey into the Land of Promise to the house of Manannan, since thou hast learnt nothing there, except consuming food and practising foolish things, and it is hard on me that my wife has been taken into Leinster, since / have not made

25 "friendship without refusal" with the king of Leinster's attendant, as thou didst with the king of Leinster, thus being unable to follow thy wife.' 'No one deems that worse than I myself,' said Mongan.

12. And Mongan said to Mac an Daimh: 'Go,' saith he, 30 'to the cave of the door, in which we left the basket of . . .,2

and a sod from Ireland and another from Scotland in it, that I may go with thee on thy back; for the king of Leinster will

ask of his wizards news of me, and tJiey will say that I am with one foot in Ireland, and with the other in Scotland, and he will say that as long as I am like that he need not fear me.'

13. And in that way they set out. And that was the hour and time in which the feast of Moy-LifTey was held in Leinster, 5 and they came to the Plain of Cell Chamain in Leinster, and there beheld the hosts and multitudes and the king of Leinster going past them to the feast, and they recognised him. ' That

is sad, O Mac an Daimh,' said Mongan, 'evil is the journey on which we have come.' And they saw the holy cleric going 10 past them, even Tibraide, the priest of Cell Chamain, with his four gospels in his own hand, and the . . . ^ upon the back of a cleric by his side, and they reading their offices. And wonder seized Mac an Daimh as to what the cleric said, and he kept asking Mongan: 'What did he say?' Mongan said 15 it was reading, and he asked Mac an Daimh whether he understood a little of it. ' I do not understand,' said Mac an Daimh, 'except that the man at his back says "Amen, amen."'

14. Thereupon Mongan shaped a large river through the midst of the plain in front of Tibraide, and a large bridge 20 across it. And Tibraide marvelled at that and began to bless himself. "Tis here,' he said, 'my father was bom and my grandfather, and never did I see a river here. But as the river has got there, it is well there is a bridge across it.' They proceeded to the bridge, and when they had reached 25 its middle, it fell under them, and Mongan snatched the gospels out of Tibraide's hand, and sent them^ down the river. And he asked Mac an Daimh whether he should drown them.

' Certainly, let them be drowned! ' said Mac an Daimh. ' We will not do it,' said Mongan. ' We will let them down the 30 river the length of a mile, till we have done our task in the fortress.'

15. Mongan took on himself the shape of Tibraide, and gave Mac an Daimh the shape of the cleric, with a large

tonsure on his head, and the . . . on his back. And they go onward before the king of Leinster, who welcomed Tibraide and gave him a kiss, and "Tis long that I have not seen thee, O Tibraide,' he said, 'and read the gospel to us and 5 proceed before us to the fortress. And let Ceibhin Cochlach, the attendant of my chariot, go with thee. And the queen, the wife of the king of Ulster, is there and would like to confess to thee.' And while Mongan was reading the gospel, Mac an Daimh would say ' Amen, amen.' The hosts said they

lo had never seen a priest who had but one word except that cleric; for he said nothing but ' amen.'

i6. And Mongan went onward to the front of the fortress in which Dubh-Lacha was. And she recognised him. And Mac an Daimh said: 'Leave the house all of ye, so that

15 the queen may make her confession.' And her nurse or foster sister ventured out of boldness to stay there. Mac an Daimh closed his arms around her and put her out, and said that no one should be with the queen except the woman that had come with her. And he closed the bower after them

20 and put the glazen door to it, and opened the window of glass. And he lifted his own wife into bed with him, but no sooner than Mongan had taken Dubh-Lacha with him. And Mongan sat down by her shoulder and gave her three kisses, and carried her into bed with him, and had his will and pleasure

25 of her. And when that had been done, the hag who guarded the jewels, who was in the corner, began to speak; for they had not noticed her until then. And Mongan sent a swift magical breath at her, so that what she had seen was no longer clear to her. ' That is sad,' said the hag, ' do not rob

3(j me of Heaven, O holy cleric! For the thought that I have uttered is wrong, and accept my repentance, for a lying vision has appeared to me, and I dearly love my foster-child.' 'Come hither to me, hag! ' said Mongan, ' and confess to me.' The hag arose, and Mongan shaped a sharp spike in the chair,

35 and the hag fell upon the spike, and found death. 'A blessing on thee, O Mongan,' said the queen, ' it is a good thing for us
to have killed the woman, for she would have told what we have done.'

17. Then they heard a knocking at the door, and 'tis he that was there, even Tibraide, and three times nine men with him. The doorkeepers said: 'We never saw a year in 5 which Tibraides were more plentiful than this year. Ye have

a Tibraide within and a Tibraide without.' "Tis true,' said Mongan.^ ' Mongan has come in my shape. Come out,' said he, 'and I will reward you, and let yonder clerics be killed, for they are noblemen of Mongan's that have been 10 put into the shape of clerics.' And the men of the household came out and killed the clerics, and twice nine of them fell. And the king of Leinster came to them and asked them what course they were on. 'Mongan,' said they, 'has come in Tibraide's shape, and Tibraide is in the place.' And the king I5 of Leinster charged them, and Tibraide reached the church of Cell Chamain, and none of the remaining nine escaped without a wound.

18. And the king of Leinster came to his house, and then Mongan departed. And the king asked: 'Where is Tibraide?' 20 saith he. ' It was not Tibraide that was here,' said the woman,

' but Mongan, since you will hear it.' 'Were you with Mongan, girl?' said he. 'I was,' said she, 'for he has the greatest claim on me.' 'Send for Tibraide,' said the king, 'for , . .^ we have chanced to kill his people.' And Tibraide was brought to them, 25 and Mongan went home and did not come again until the end of a quarter, and during that time he was in a wasting sickness.

19. And Mac an Daimh came to him and said to him: 'Tis wearisome to me,' said he, ' to be without my wife through a clown like myself, since I have not made "friendship without 3° refusal" with the king of Leinster's attendant.' 'Go thou for me,' said Mongan, 'to get news to R£ith Descirt of Bregia, where Dubh-Lacha of the White Hand is, for I am not myself

^ I do not understand mur aith.

able to go.' ^ Thereafter Dubh-Lacha said: 'Let Mongan come to me,' said she, ' for the king of Leinster is on a journey around Leinster, and Ceibhin Cochlach, the attendant of the king's chariot, is with me and keeps telling me to escape, and

5 that he himself would come with me. And Mongan behaves in a weak manner,' ^ said she. And Mac an Daimh went to incite Mongan.

20. Thereupon Mongan set out to Raith Descirt of Bregia, and he sat down at the shoulder of the girl, and a gilded chess-

10 board was brought to them, and they played. And DubhLacha bared her breasts to Mongan, and as he looked upon them, he beheld the great paps, which were soft and white, and the middle small and shining-white. And desire of the girl came upon him. And Dubh-Lacha obsei-ved it. Just then the

IS king of Leinster with his hosts was drawing near the fortress, and the fortress was opened before him. And the king of Leinster asked of the girl whether Mongan had been in the house. She said he had been. ' I wish to obtain a request of thee, girl,' said the king of Leinster. ' It shall be granted.

2Q Except thy being with me till the year is ended, there is nothing that thou mayst ask which I will not grant thee.' 'If that be so,' said the king, 'tell me when thou longest for Mongan son of Fiachna; for when Mongan has gone, thou wilt long for him.'

25 21. At the end of a quarter Mongan returned, and he was longing for her; and all the hosts of the place were there at the time. Then the hosts of the place came out, and Mongan turned back from the fortress and went home. And that quarter he was in a wasting sickness. And the nobles of Ulster

30 assembled into one place and offered Mongan to go with him to make battle for the sake of his wife. 'By my word,' said Mongan, 'the woman that has been taken from me through my own folly, no woman's son of the men of Ulster shall fall for

1 The MS. has HnHubhail, the dot over the first s being a punctum delens. ^ lit. it is weak what M. does.

her sake in bringing her out, until, through my own craftiness, I myself bring her with me.'

22. And in that way the year passed by, and Mongan and Mac an Daimh set out to the king of Leinster's house. There were the nobles of Leinster going into the place, and a great S feast was being prepared towards the marriage of Dubh-Lacha. And he * vowed he would marry her. And they came to the green outside. 'O Mongan,' said Mac an Daimh, 'in what shape shall we go? ' And as they were there, they see the hag of the mill, to wit, Cuimne. And she was a hag as tall as a lo weaver's beam," and a large chain-dog with her licking the mill-stones, with a twisted rope around his neck, and Brothar was his name. And they saw a hack mare with an old packsaddle upon her, carrying com and flour from the mill.

23. And when Mongan saw them, he said to Mac an Daimh: 15 'I have the shape in which we will go,' said he, 'and if I am destined ever to obtain my wife, I shall do so this time.' 'That becomes thee, O noble prince,' [said Mac an Daimh]. ' And come, O Mac an Daimh, and call Cuimne of the mill out to me

to converse with me.' 'It is three score years [said Cuimne] 20 since any one has asked me to converse with him.' And she came out, the dog following her, and when Mongan saw them, he laughed and said to her: 'If thou wouldst take my advice, I would put thee into the shape of a young girl, and thou shouldst be as a wife with me or with the King of Leinster.' '1 25 will do that certainly,' said Cuimne. And with the magic wand he gave a stroke to the dog, which became a sleek white lapdog, the fairest that was in the world, with a silver chain around its neck and a little bell of gold on it, so that it' would have fitted into the palm of a man. And he gave a stroke to 30 the hag, who became a young girl, the fairest of form and make of the daughters of theworld,to wit, Ibhell of the Shining Cheeks,

daughter of the king of Munster. And he himself assumed the shape of Aedh, son of the king of Connaught, and Mac an Daimh he put into the shape of his attendant. And he made a shining-white palfrey with crimson hair, and of the pack5 saddle he made a gilded saddle with variegated gold and precious stones. And they mounted two other mares in the shape of steeds, and in that way they reached the fortress.

24. And the door-keepers saw them and told the king of Leinster that it was Aed the Beautiful, son of the king of

10 Connaught, and his attendant, and his wife Ibhell of the Shining Cheek, daughter of the king of Munster, exiled and banished from Connaught, that had come under the protection of the king of Leinster, and he did not wish to come with a greater host or multitude. And the door-keeper made the announce-

15 ment, and the king came to meet them, and welcomed them. And the king of Leinster called the son of the king of Connaught to his shoulder. 'That is not the custom with us,' said the son of the king of Connaught, 'but that he should sit by the side of the king who is the second best man in the palace, and

20 next to thee I am the second best in the house, and by the side of the king I will be.'

25. And the drinking-house was put in order. And Mongan put a love-charm ^ into the cheeks of the hag, and from the look which the king of Leinster cast on her he was filled with her

25 love, so that there was not a bone of his of the size of an inch, but was filled with love of the girl. And he called his attendant to him and said to him: 'Go to where the wife of the king of Connaught's son is, and say to her "the king of Leinster has bestowed great love upon thee, and that a king is better than

30 a king's heir." ' And Mongan understood the whispering, and said to Cuimne: 'There is an attendant coming from the king of Leinster with a message to thee, and I know the secret message which he brings, and if thou wouldst take my advice, thou wouldst not be with a worse man than myself or the king

^ Instead of blickt I read bricht.

of Leinster.' 'I have no choice' of bridegroom, whichever of you will be husband to me.' 'If that be so,' said Mongan, 'when he comes to thee, say that by his gifts and precious things thou wilt know him who loves thee, and ask him for the drinkinghorn which he brings thee.' 5

26. And the king of Leinster's attendant came to converse with her, and said: 'Here is a noble horn brought to thee.' 'We should know him who loves us by gifts and precious things.' And the king of Leinster said to the attendant:

' Give her my horn.' But the king's household said: 'Do not 10 give thy treasures to the wife of the King of Connaught's son.' 'I will give them,' said the king of Leinster, 'for the woman and my treasures will come to me.' And Mac an Daimh takes the horn from her and whatever else she got of treasures till the morning. 15

27. And Mongan said to Cuimne: 'Ask the king of Leinster for his girdle.' And the girdle was of such a nature that neither sickness nor trouble would seize the side on which it was. And she demanded the girdle, and the king of Leinster gave it her, and Mac an Daimh forthwith took it from her. 20 ' And now say to the king of Leinster's attendant, if the (whole) world were given thee, thou wouldst not leave thy own husband for him.' And the attendant told that to the king of Leinster, who said: 'What is it you notice?' 'Are you in the house

. . .?' said they. 'You know this woman by my side, to wit, 25 Dubh-Lacha of the White Hands, daughter of Fiachna Dubh son of Deman. I took her from him on terms of "friendship without refusal," and if thou like, I would exchange with thee.' And great anger and ferocity seized him,^ and he said: 'If I had brought steeds and studs with me, it would be right to ask 30 them of me. However, it is not right to refuse a lord . . ., though I am loath it should be so, take her to thee.' And as they made the exchange, Mongan gave three kisses to the girl,

' For tiigha Father Henebry conjectures togha. '' viz. Mongan.

and said: 'Every one would say that we did not make the exchange from our hearts, if I did not give these kisses.' And they indulged themselves until they were drunk and hilarious. 28. And Mac an Daimh arose and said: 'It is a great shame S that no one puts drink into the hand of the king of Connaught's son.' And as no one answered him, he took the two best steeds that were in the fortress, and Mongan put swiftness of wind into them. And Mongan placed Dubh-Lacha behind him, and Mac an Daimh his own wife, and they set forth. And when on

10 the morrow the household of the king of Leinster arose, they saw the cloak of the hag, and the grey tall hag on the bed of the king of Leinster. And they saw the dog with a twisted halter round his neck, and they saw the hack mare and the pack-saddle. . . . And the people laughed and awoke the king

IS of Leinster, who saw the hag by his side and said: 'Art thou the grey-backed hag of the mill?' 'I am,' said she. 'Pity that I should have slept with thee, O Cuimne!'

CM. The Conception of Mongan . `[Nutt and Meyer, The Voyage of Bran, Vol. I, p. 44 ff.]`

' Fiachna Lurga, the father of Mongan, was sole king of the province. He had a friend in Scotland, to wit, Aedan, the son of Gabr&n. A message went from him to Aedan. A message went from Aedan to him that he would come to his aid. He was in warfare against the Saxons. A terrible warrior was brought by them for the death of Aedan in the battle. Then Fiachna went across. He left his queen at home. While the hosts were fighting in Scotland, a noble-looking man went to his wife in his stronghold in Rathmore of Moylinny. At the time he went there were not many in the stronghold. He asked the woman to arrange a place of meeting. The woman said there were not in the world possessions or treasures, for which she would do anything to disgrace her husband's honour. He asked her whether she would do it to save her husband's life. She said that if she were to see him in danger and difficulty, she would help him with all that lay in her might. He said she should do it then, for thy husband is in great danger. A terrible man has been brought against him on (against) whom they cannot [prevail], and he will die by his hand. If we, I and thou, make love, thou wilt bear a son thereof. That son will be famous; he will be Mongin. I shall go to the battle which will be fought tomorrow at the third hour, so that I shall save him, and I shall vanquish the warrior before the eyes of the men of Scotland. And I shall tell thy husband our adventures, and that it is thou that hast sent me to his help.”

It was done thus. When army was drawn up against army, the hosts saw something—a noble-looking man before the army of Aedin and Fiachna. He went towards Fiachna in particular, and told him the conversation with his wife the day before, and that he had promised to come to his help at that hour. Thereupon he went before the army towards the other, and vanquished the soldier. And the battle was routed before Aedin and Fiachna.

And Fiachna returned to his country. And the woman was pregnant and bore a son, even Mongin son of Fiachna. And he thanked his wife for what she had done for him, and she confessed all her adventures. So that this Mongan is a son of Manannan mac Lir, though he is called Mongin son of Fiachna. For when he went from her in the morning he left a quatrain with Mongin's mother, saying:
"I go home,
The pale pure morning draws near:
Moninnin son of Ler
Is the name of him who came to thee.” '

CMD. The Conception of Mongán and Dub-Lacha's Love for Mongdn. `[Nutt and Meyer, The Voyage of Bran, I, pp. 70-84.]`

"Once upon a time Fiachna Finn went from Ireland to Lochlann, 2 where Eolgarg Mor was then king, and there he found great respect and love and honour. He had not been there long when the King of Lochlann fell ill, and his physicians told him that nothing could cure him except a red-eared shining-white cow which was to be boiled for him. This cow was found in the possession of Caillech Dub (Black Hag). She refused to give the cow except under condition that Fiachna should become security. Now this was the hour and time that messengers came for Fiachna Finn, the son of Baet£n, and he went with those messengers, and took the kingship of Ulster, and was king for one year.

One day Fiachna found the hag outside his ddn demanding her security. She told him that the King of Lochlann had not paid for the cow as arranged. Fiachna offered to pay a price on his behalf but she refused. After much bargaining, the hag said, "if all the kine of the province of Ulster were given to me, I would not take them, until thou come thyself to make war upon the king of Lochlann.”

Then Fiachna took the nobles of Ulster to attack Lochlann. The King of Lochlann sent venomous sheep against them, and for three days three hundred of Fiachna's warriors were killed by the sheep each day. Fiachna prepared to go and fight against the sheep in spite of the protest of his men. While they were discussing the matter, they saw a tall warrior coming towards them. He wore a green cloak of one colour, and a brooch of white silver in the cloak over his breast, and a satin shirt next his white skin. A circlet of gold around his hair, and two sandals of gold under his feet. The warrior offered to keep the sheep from him if Fiachna gave him that ring of gold on thy finger as a token for me, when I go to Ireland to thy wife to sleep with her ... It shall be none the worse for thee; for a glorious child shall be begotten by me there, and from thee he shall be named, even Mongin the Fair (Finn), son of Fiachna the Fair. And I shall go there in thy shape, so that thy wife shall not be defiled by it. And I am Manannan, son of Ler, and thou shalt seize the kingship of Lochlann and of the Saxons and Britons.” So it was agreed and the strange warrior went to Ireland and in the shape of Fiachna himself he slept with Fiachna's wife, and in that night she became pregnant. On that day the sheep were destroyed and Fiachna seized the kingship of Lochlann and of the Saxons and Britons. Fiachna then paid the Black Hag and returned into Ireland from Lochlann and found his wife pregnant, and, when her time came, she bore a son. When Mongan was three nights old, Manannan came for him and took him with him to bring him up in the Land of Promise, and vowed that he would not let him go back into Ireland before he were twelve years of age.'

p28-9

Fiachna Finn was King of Ireland and Manannan mac Lir was King of the Other-world or Lochlann. Manannan was in love with Fiachna's wife and this is the ruse by which he was enabled to lie with her with her husband's consent. By a trick he compelled Fiachna to make war upon him, and because he was King of the Other-world and had therefore control of all ' magic and enchantment ', Fiachna was in danger of defeat and death. When things were at their worst, he appeared before Fiachna on the battle-field as a tall warrior marvellously clad. He offered to help Fiachna to defeat his enemy, who was of course Manannan himself, for a consideration, namely that they should change forms and that Manannan should go to Ireland to Fiachna's court in Fiachna's form and sleep with Fiachna's wife. He said ' I shall go there in thy shape so that thy wife shall not be defiled by it.' So it was agreed, and Fiachna in Manannan's form was able to conquer his enemy and seize the kingship of Lochlann. At the same time Fiachna's wife became pregnant by Manannan in Fiachna's form.

Thus the child Mongan born to Fiachna's wife was the son of Manannan though he was also the son of Fiachna, because he was begotten by Manannan in Fiachna's form. Then Manannan came and stole his son Mongan when he was three nights old and took him to the Other-world where he kept him for twelve years.
