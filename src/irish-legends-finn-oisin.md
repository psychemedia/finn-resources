He must be versed in the Twelve Books of Poetry, and must himself be skilled to make verse in the rime and metre of the masters of Gaelic poesy. Then he was buried to his middle in the earth, and must, with a shield and a hazel stick, there defend himself against nine warriors casting spears at him, and if he were wounded he was not accepted. Then his hair was woven into braids, and he was chased through the forest by the Fians. If he were ovetaken, or if a braid of his hair were disturbed, or if a dry stick cracked under his foot, he was not accepted. He must be able to leap over a lath level with his brow, and to run at full speed under one level with his knee, and he must he able white running to draw out a thorn from his foot and never slacken speed. He must take no dowry with a wife.

The Questions put by Finn to the Maiden,
AND HER Answers.
1. " What is more numerous than the grass?" said Finn (Fionn).
" The dew-drops," said the maiden.
2. " What is whiter than the snow ?'' said Finn.
" Truth," said the maiden.
3. " What is lovehest of hue ?" said Finn.
" The bloom of childhood," said the maiden.
4. " What is hotter than fire ?" said Finn.
" The hospitable man's face when a stranger Cometh and there is nothing to offer him," said the maiden.
5. " What is swifter than the wind ?" said Finn.
" The mind of a woman," said the maiden.
6. " What is sharper than a sword ?" said Finn.
" A woman's wit between two men," said the maiden.
7. " What is bitterer than poison ?" said Finn. " The reproach of an enemy," said the
maiden.
8. "What is blacker than the raven ?" said Finn.
" Death," said the maiden.
9. " What is best for a hero ?" said Finn.
" High deeds and humble pride," said the maiden.
10. "What is best for a woman ?"said Finn. " Generous tenderness," said the maiden.
11. "What is softer than down ?" said Finn. " The palm* of the cheek," said the maiden.
12. " What is best of jewels ?" said Finn. " A knife," said the maiden.

" Death," said the maiden.
9. " What is best for a hero ?" said Finn.
" High deeds and humble pride," said the maiden.
10. "What is best for a woman ?"said Finn. " Generous tenderness," said the maiden.
11. "What is softer than down ?" said Finn. " The palm* of the cheek," said the maiden.
12. " What is best of jewels ?" said Finn. " A knife," said the maiden.
Note.— Compare Campbell, Popular Tales, vol. iii, pp. 36-37. There are instructive variations between the two versions. Nos. 3 and 10 are not in Campbell. In No. 4 the question in Campbell runs : " What is redder than blood ?" whilst Campbell gives as the answer to " What is hotter than fire ? — A woman's reasoning betwixt two men," which certainly does not seem right. On the other hand, Campbell gives : "A woman's thought between two men," as the answer to our No. 5. I am inclined to think this is more correct than our version. See the tale of Michael Scott, and my note, supra, pp. 52-3. Our No. 9 runs thus in Campbell: "What deed is the best of deeds? — A high deed and low conceit," which may be more morale but is not as delightfully characteristic of the Highland temperament as our version. Campbell has about half as many riddles again as our ver- sion, but only one is of great interest : "What is it will not bide lock and chain ? — The eye of a man about his friend ; it will not brook shutting or holding, but looking on him." In Campbell the maiden is Graine, Finn's wife, and Mr. Hector MacLean cites the tradition that he married her, as she was the only woman who could answer all his questions.
