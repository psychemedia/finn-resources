THE LAY OF OISIN IN THE LAND OF YOUTH  
As he told it to St. Patrick. 

PROLOGUE.

I.  
Patrick : O noble Oisín, son of the king,  
Whose deeds men sing this day in song !  
Thy grief abate and to us relate  
By what strange fate thou hast lived so long !

II.  
Oisín : O Patrick, here's the tale for thee,  
Tho' sad to me its memories old —  
'Twas after Gavra — I mind me well,  
The field where fell my Oscar bold !

THE LAY:

I. GOLDEN-HAIRED NIAMH.

III.  
One day the generous Finn my sire  
With olden fire led forth the chase —  
But our band was small when gather'd all,  
For past recall were the hosts of our race.

IV.  
'Twas a summer's morn and a mist hung o'er  
The winding shore of sweet Loch Lein,  
Where fragrant trees perfume the breeze  
And birds e'er please with a joyous strain.

V.  
We soon awoke the woodland deer  
That forced by fear fled far away —  
Keenly our hounds with strenuous bounds  
O'er moors and mounds pursued their prey.

VI.  
When lo ! into sight came a figure bright,  
In a blaze of light from the west it rushed—  
A lady fair of radiance rare  
Whom a white steed bare to our band, now hush'd !

VII.  
Amazed we halt, though hot the chase,  
To gaze on the face of the fair young queen—  
A marvel to Finn and his Fenian band  
Who ne'er in the land such beauty had seen !

VIII.  
A golden crown on her brow she bore,  
A mantle she wore of silken sheen  
All studded with stars of bright red gold —  
Ample each fold fell on herbage green.

IX.  
Her golden hair all fair to view  
In golden curls on her shoulders fell —  
Bright and pure were her eyes of blue  
As drops of the dew in a blue hare-bell,

X.  
Ruddier far her cheek than the rose  
Her bosom more white than the swan's so free,  
Sweeter the breath of her balmy mouth  
Than spice of the south from over the sea.

XI.  
Her milk-white steed was of worth untold  
Nor bridle of gold did the charger lack —  
A saddle all covered with purple and gold  
Lay bright to behold on the steed's proud back

XII.  
Four shoes of gold his hoofs did guard,  
Of gold unmarred by mixture base,  
A silver wreath on his crest was shown —  
Such steed was unknown on the earth's fair face.

XIII.  
To Finn's great presence drew the maid  
This bright array'd and softly spake —  
" King of the Fenian host, " she cried  
" Far have I hied for sweet love's sake ! "

XIV.  
" Who art thou, pray, O princess rare,  
Of form most fair, of face divine ?  
Gently thy errand to us make known —  
What land's thine own, what name is thine ? "

XV.  
" Niamh the Golden-haired I'm named,  
— O Finn far-famed for wisdom and truth ! —  
My praise harps ring, and bards e'er sing,  
And my sire's the King of the Land of Youth ! "

XVI.  
" Then tell us most lovely lady now,  
Why comest thou o'er seas so far ?  
Has heartless husband left thee to weep  
With grief most deep, thy mind to mar !"

XVII.  
" No husband has left me, O lordly Finn,  
— My heart within ne'er man did gain,  
Till hero of Erin, thy famous son,  
Its young love won, for aye to reign ! "

XVIII.  
" On which of my gallant sons, O maid,  
Is thy heart's love laid, so frankly free ?  
Now hide not from us, O princess dear,  
The causes clear of thy visit to me ! "

XIX.  
" His name, O Finn, then I'll declare —  
'Tis thy famed son, so fair, so brave,  
Oisín the warrior, Erin's bard,  
My fair reward for crossing the wave ! "

XX.  
" Then why hast thou hastened to give thy love  
O maiden above all maids most fair —  
To Oisín my own beyond all known  
Of princes high both rich and rare ? "

XI.  
" Good cause I ween for my course 'he &ecn,  
O king of tbe Fiann when I tell thee truth,  
Oisín's high deeds and noble name  
Have won him fame in the Land of Youth.

XXII.  
" Full many a prince of high degree  
Hath offered me both heart and hand  
But whoso appealed I ne'er did yield  
But my heart kept sealed for my hero grand ! "

XXIII.  
Oisín: O Patrick stern, how my soul did yearn  
And with ardour burn for the peerless maid —  
No shame to tell — each word was a spell,  
That bound me well past mortal aid.

XXIV.  
I took her gentle hand in mine  
And with every sign of love I said,  
" Welcome a hundred thousand times,  
From fairy climes, O royal maid ! "

XXY.  
" Of women the rarest, fairest seen,  
Thou art O queen, without compeer !  
My soul, my life, my chosen wife,  
Star of my way of ray most clear ! "

II. THE DELIGHTS OF THE LAND OF YOUTH.

XXVI.  
" Request refused by no true knight  
Who knoweth aright the knightly vogue,  
I make of thee now — 'tis hence to speed  
With me on my steed to *Tír na n-Óg*.

XXVII.  
Delightful land beyond all dreams !  
Beyond what seems to thee most fair —  
Rich fruits abound the bright year round  
And flowers are found of hues most rare.

XXVIII.  
Unfailing there the honey and wine  
And draughts divine of mead there be,  
No ache nor ailing night or day —  
Death or decay thou ne'er shalt see !

XXIX.  
" The mirthful feast and joyous play  
And musíc's sway all blest, benign—  
Silver untold and store of gold  
Undreamt by the old shall all be thine !

XXX.  
" A hundred swords of steel refined  
A hundred cloaks of kind full rare,  
A hundred steeds of proudest breed  
A hundred hounds — thy meed when there !

XXXI.  
" A hundred coats of mail shall be thine  
A hundred kine of sleekest skin,  
A hundred sheep with fleece of gold  
And gems none hold these shores within.

XXXII.  
" A hundred maidens young and fair  
Of blithesome air shall tend on thee,  
Of form most meet, as fairies fleet  
And of song more sweet than the wild thrush free !

XXXIII,  
" A hundred knights in fights most bold  
Of skill untold in all chivalrie,  
Full-armed, bedight in mail of gold  
Shall in *Tír na n-Óg* thy comrades be.

XXXIV.  
" A corslet charmed for thee shall be made  
And a matchless blade of magic power,  
Worth a hundred blades in a hero's hands,  
Most blest of brands in battle's hour !

XXXV.  
"The royal crown of the King of Youth  
Shall shine in sooth on thy brow most fair,  
All brilliant with gems of lustre bright  
Whose worth aright none might declare.

XXXVI.  
" All things I've named thou shalt enjoy  
And none shall cloy — to endless life —  
Beauty and strength and power thou'lt see  
And I'll e'er be thy own true wife ! "

XXXVII.  
" Refusal of mine thou ne'er shalt hear  
O maid without peer, of the locks of gold !  
My chosen wife for life I know  
And gladly I'll go to *Tír na n-Óg*!"

III. THE DEPARTURE TO Tír NA N-ÓG.

XXXVIII.  
Forthwith the steed I then bestrode  
Before me rode my royal queen  
Who said " O Oisín with caution ride  
Till side of dividing sea we've seen ! "

XXXIX.  
Then up rose that steed with a mighty bound  
Gave forth three sounding startling neighs,  
His mane he shook, then with fiery look  
His riders he took to the sea's known ways.

XL.  
Now when from Finn and the Fenian host  
The steed to the coast was coursing so,  
There burst from the chief a cry of grief  
A wail of grief not brief nor low.

XLI.  
" Oh Oisín " cried Finn with faltering voice —  
" My son most choice must I then lose,  
With never a hope to see thee again ?  
— My heart in twain 'twill break and bruise!"

XLII.  
His noble features now clouded o'er  
And tears did pour in showers free  
Till breast and beard in tears were drowned —  
" My grief ! he e'er found this maid from the Sea ! "

XLIII.  
Oh Patrick I grieve to tell thee the tale  
My words now fail to find their way —  
How the father did part from the son of his heart,  
My tears e'er start when I think of the day.

XLIV.  
I drew up the steed for a moment's rest  
And tenderly pressed on my sire a kiss,  
Then bade farewell to the Fenian band  
Tho' the tears did stand in my eyes, I wis,

XLV.  
Full many a day great Finn and I  
And our host all nigh in gay array  
Held glorious feast where harps ne'er ceased  
And highest and least had their choice alway.

XLVI.  
Full oft our race held a royal chase  
While at boldest pace ran our sweet-voiced hounds —  
Anon in battle our javelins rattle  
And men like cattle fall in heaps and mounds !

XLVII.  
Patrick : O vain old Oisín, dwell no more  
On thy deeds of yore in the Fenian ranks,  
How didst thou go to *Tír na n-Óg* ?  
Come let me know and I'll owe much thanks.

XLVIII.  
Oisín : We turned away as I truly said  
And our horse's head we gave to the west,  
When lo ! the deep sea opened before  
While behind us bore the billows that pressed.

XLIX.  
Anon we saw in our path strange sights,  
Cities on heights and castles fair,  
Palaces brilliant with lights and flowers —  
The brightest of bowers were gleaming there.

L.  
And then we saw a yellow young fawn  
Leap over a lawn of softest green,  
Chased by a graceful, snow-white hound  
That with airy bound pressed on most keen.

LI.  
We next beheld— I tell thee true,  
A maid in view on a bright bay steed,  
An apple of gold in her hand did she hold,  
O'er the waves most bold she hied with speed.

LII.  
And soon we saw another sight  
A youthful knight who a white steed rode,  
The rider in purple and crimson array'd  
Whilst a glittering blade in his hand he showed.

LIII.  
" Yon youthful pair bothlcnight and maid —  
" Pray tell " I said " who they may be—  
The lady mild as a summer's morn  
And knight high-born that fares so free."

LIV.  
" In all thy sight may light on here  
O Oisín dear, I say with truth,  
There's nought of beauty, nought of strength,  
Till we reach at length the Land of Youth!"

IV. — FOVOR OF THE BLOWS.

LV.  
And now as we rode we came in sight  
Of a palace bright, high-placed, and strong,  
Shapely its hall and lofty its wall  
Far beyond all e'er famed in song.

LVI.  
" What royal *Dún* is yon, O queen,  
That stands serene on yon hill-side,  
Whose towers and columns so stately spring —  
What prince or king doth there abide ? "

LVII.  
" In yonder *Dún* a sad queen dwells  
Whom force compels her life to mourn —  
Whom Fovor fierce of the Mighty Blows  
Doth there enclose from friends' arms torn.

LVIII.  
" But captive though to that pirate proud  
She yet hath vowed by geasa grave,  
Never for life to be his wife  
Till won in strife 'gainst champion brave ! "

LIX.  
"Blessing and bliss be thine " I cried  
" O maid bright eyed, for thy welcome word,  
Tho' grieved that woman such fate should meet  
Music more sweet I ne'er have heard !

LX.  
" For now we'll go to that high-placed *Dún*  
And help full soon that maid distressed,  
A champion's steel shall Fovor feel  
And 'neath my heel shall his neck be pressed ! "

LXI.  
To Fovor's stronghold then we rode-—  
Unblest abode for a captive sweet !  
Atonce the queen with joyous mien,  
Came forth on the green with welcome meet.

LXII.  
In robe of rich-hued silk arrayed  
Was this queenly maid with the brow of snow,  
Her neck all fair could with swan's compare  
Her cheeks did wear the rose's glow.

LXIII.  
Of golden hue was her hair, 'tis true,  
Of heavenly blue her bright eyes clear,  
Her lips were red as berries on bough,  
Shapely each brow with rare compeer !

LXIV.  
To seat ourselves we then were told —  
In a chair of gold each one sat down,  
Most royal fare was set forth there  
In royal ware of great renown.

LXV.  
Now when of food we had had our fill  
And of wine as will might fancy e'en,  
Thus spoke the queen, her face now pale,  
Now list my tale, with ears all keen !

LXVI.  
From first to last she told her tale  
Her cheek all pale and wet with tears —  
How kith and kin ne'er more she'd see  
Whilst Fovor free provoked her fears.

LXVII.  
" Then weep no more, O fair young queen,  
Henceforth I ween, thou needst not mourn,  
Fovor shall pay with his life this day  
In mortal fray for the wrongs thou'st borne!"

LXVIII.  
" Alas ! no champion can be found  
On earth's great round, I fear me much,  
Could hand to hand such foe withstand  
Or free me from this tyrant's clutch. "

LXIX.  
" I tell thee truly lady fair  
I'll boldly dare him to the field  
Resolved to save thee or in strife  
Never while life doth last to yield !"

LXX.  
Ere cease my words, in savage trim  
The giant grim against us hies —  
In skins of beasts uncouthly clad,  
Whilst a club he had of monstrous size.

LXXI.  
No salutation from him came  
But his eyes aflame glared all around,  
Forthwith he challenged me to fight  
And I with delight took up my ground.

LXXII.  
For full three nights and eke three days  
Our deadly fray's end seemed in doubt  
Till at length his head with my sword I sped  
O'er the plain now red with the blood pour'd out!

LXXIII  
Now when the two young maids beheld  
Fierce Fovor felled by my good sword,  
They gave three shouts of joy and glee  
Of joy for freedom now restored.

LXXIV.  
We then returned to the giant's *dún*  
Where faint in swoon at last I fell,  
Faint from wounds and loss of blood  
That still in flood gushed like a well.

LXXV.  
But now the maid from Fovor freed  
Ran up with speed to help me fain —  
My wounds she washed, and bathed with balm,  
And health and calm I found again,

LXXVI.  
The giant grim we buried him  
Deep down in earth in widest grave —  
We raised a stone his grave to note  
And his name we wrote in Ogham-craev.

LXXVII.  
A merry feast we then did hold  
And stories told of olden days —  
And when night fell we rested well  
On couches such as poets praise.

LXXVIII.  
When morning fair the sun did greet  
From slumbers sweet we fresh awoke —  
" Dear friends from hence I now depart—  
'Twas thus the parting princess spoke.

LXXIX,  
We soon equipped us for our way  
For longer stay was needed not,  
Sad, sorrowful the leave we took,  
And sad the princess' look, I wot.

LXXX.  
The further fate of that sweet maid  
O Patrick staid, I could not tell,  
No word of her I've heard one say  
E'er since the day we said farewell

V. — IN THE LAND OF YOUTH.

LXXXI  
We turned once more upon our course  
And wildly sped our horse along —  
No wind that sweeps the mountain drift  
Was half so swift or half so strong.

LXXXII.  
But now the sky began to lower,  
The wind in power increased full fast —  
Red lightning lights the mad sea-waves  
And madly raves the thunder past !

LXXXIII.  
A while we cowered 'neath the storm,  
— All nature's form in darkness dread —  
When lo ! the winds' fierce course was run,  
And bright the sun appear'd o'erhead !

LXXXIV.  
And now there spread before our sight  
A land most bright, most rich, and fair,  
With hill and plain and shady bower  
And a royal tower of splendour rare.

LXXXV.  
And ín this royal mansion fair  
All colours were that eye hath seen—  
The blue most bright, the purest white  
With purple and yellow and softest green.

LXXXVI.  
To left and right of this palace bright  
Rose many a hall and sun-lit tower,  
All built of brilliant gems and stones  
By hands one owns of wondrous power.

LXXXVII.  
" What lovely land is that we see ?  
Pray answer me with maiden's truth—  
Is't penned in page that man may read,  
Or is it indeed the Land of Youth ?

LXXXVIII.  
" It is indeed the Land of Youth —  
And maiden's truth I've ever told —  
No joy or bliss I've promised thee  
But thou shalt see this land doth hold ! "

XXXIX.  
And now there rode frorn the king's abode  
To meet us on the lawn of green  
Thrice fifty champions of might  
In armour bright, of noble mien.

XC.  
And then there came in hues arrayed  
A hundred maids in maiden vogue —  
In silken garments bright and brave  
Who welcome gave to *Tír na n-Óg* .

XCI.  
And next marcbed forth a chosen band  
Of the troops of that land, a lovely sight —  
A king at their head of kingly tread  
Of mighty name and fame in fight.

XCII.  
A yellow shirt of silken weft,  
A cloak most deftly broidered o'er  
On the king in folds hung freely down  
Whilst a glittering crown on his head he wore.

XCIIÍ.  
And close behind him there was seen  
His youthful queen — a consort meet –  
With fifty maidens in her train  
Who sang a strain divinely sweet,

XCIV.  
Then spoke the king in kindly voice,  
" O friends rejoice, for here you see  
Oisín the famous son of Finn,  
Who spouse of winsome Niamh shall be ! "

XCV.  
He takes me warnly by the hand  
Then as we stand he speaks anew —  
" Welcome " he cries " I give thee now,  
A hundred thousand welcomes true !

XCVI.  
This kingdom which o'er seas and lands  
Thou'st sought, now stands reveal'd to thee  
Long shalt thou live our race among  
And ever young as thou shalt see.

XCVII.  
No pleasure e'er that entered mind  
But here thou'lt find without alloy,  
This is the land thy bards e'er sing  
And I am the King of this Land of Joy.

XCVIII.  
" Here is our gentle, fair young queen,  
Mother of Niamh the Golden-baired  
Who crossed for thee the stormy sea  
And thine to be all dangers dared ! "

XCIX.  
I thanked the king with grateful heart  
To the queen apart I bowed me low —  
We tarried no longer without the walls  
But entered the halls of *Ri na n-Óg* .

C.  
There came the nobles of all that land  
The great and grand to sing our praise—  
And feast was held with all delights  
For ten long nights and ten long days.

CI.  
I then was wedded to Gold-haired Niamh —  
And there to leave the tale were well —  
Thus did I go to Tír-na-n-Og  
Though grief and woe 'tis now to tell.

CII.  
Patrick : Come finish the charming tale thou'st told,  
O Oisín of gold, of the weapons of war—  
Why from such land didst thou e'er return ?  
I fain would learn what the causes are.

CIII.  
And say whilst there thou didst abide  
If thee thy bride any children bore,  
Or wast thou for long in the Land of Youth ? —  
I long in truth to list such lore !

CIV.  
Oisín : I had by Niamh of the Golden Hair  
Three children fair as ever smiled  
Whose sweetness gave us daily joys—  
Two gallant boys and a maiden mild.

CV.  
Patrick : O sweet-voiced Oisín, do not grieve, —  
Where didst thou leave those children sweet?  
Tell me the names of thy offspring fair,  
And tell me where they mirthful meet.

CVI.  
Oisín : Those children three rich heirs would be  
To kingdoms free and fair and great,  
To roval sceptre, crown of gold  
And wealth untold, no tongue could state.

CVII.  
My gentle Niamh on her boys bestowed  
The names I owed most honour to —  
Finn the bright of the hosts of might,  
And Oscar who'd fight for the right and true

CVIII.  
And I my daughter fair did call  
By a name which all fair names o'ershades —  
In beauty's virtue and sweetness , power  
By rightful dower — the Flower-of-Maids

VI. The return from Tír-na-n-Óg.

CIX.  
Long lived I there as now appears  
Tho' short the years seemed e'er to me,  
Till a strong desire of my heart took hold  
Finn and my friends of old to see.

CX.  
One day of the king I asked for leave  
And of loving Niamh who grieved the while,  
To visit dear Erin once again  
My native plain, my native isle.

CXI.  
" I will not hinder thee, " she cried,  
" From crossing the tide for duty dear,  
Tho' it bodes me ill and my heart doth fill  
With doubts that chill and deadly fear ! "

CXII.  
" Why shouldst thou fear, O queen my own,  
When the way shall be shown by the magic steed  
The steed that bore us o'er the sea —  
And home to thee I'll safely speed ? "

CXIII.  
" Remember then what now I say —  
If thou shouldst lay a foot to ground  
There's no return for thee e'ermore  
To this fair shore where home thou'st found !

CXIV.  
I tell thee truly vain's thy might  
Shouldst thou alight from thy white steed,  
For never again shouldst thou in truth  
See Land of Youth or hither speed.

CXV.  
" A third time now I thee implore  
And beg thee sore thy seat to hold,  
Or else at once thy strength shall go,  
And thou shalt grow both blind and old !

CXVI.  
" 'Tis woe to me, Oisín, to see  
How thou canst be so anxious-soul'd  
About green Erin, changed for aye —  
For past's the day of the Fenians bold.

CXVII.  
In Erin green there's now nought seen  
But priests full lean and troops of saints —  
Then Oisín, here's my kiss to thee,  
Our last, may be — my heart — now faints ! "

CXVIII.  
I gazed into her soft sad eyes  
Whilst the tears did rise and well in my own —  
O saint severe, thou'dst weep a tear  
To hear that dear wife's hopeless moan !

CXIX.  
By solemn vow I then was bound,  
To Erin's ground ne'er to descend,  
And if to keep this vow I failed  
No power availed or could befriend.

CXX.  
I pledged to keep my solemn vow  
And do all now enjoined had been,  
I mounted then my steed of spell  
And said farewell to king and queen.

CXXI.  
I kissed once more my Gold-haired Niamh,  
— My heart doth grieve as I tell the tale —  
I kissed my sons and daughter young  
Whose hearts were wrung and cheeks were pale.

CXXII.  
I turned my steed at last to the strand  
And passed from the Land of Lasting Youth —  
Boldly my horse pursued his course  
And the billows' force was nought in sooth.

CXXIII.  
O Patrick of the orders pure  
No lie, full sure, I'e told but truth,  
Thus have I tried my tale to weave  
And thus did I leave the Land of Youth

CXXIV.  
If of good bread I could get my fill  
As Finn at will gave to each guest  
Each day I'd pray to the King of Grace  
That Heaven might be thy place of rest.

CXXV.  
Patrick : Thou shalt of bread have quite thy fill  
And drink at will, O ancient bard !  
Dear to me thy pleasant tale !  
It ne'er can fail to win regard.

VII. Oisín in Erin.

CXXVI.  
Oisín : I need not tell each thing befell  
Me and my spell-borne steed each day,  
But at length green Erin's isle we reach,  
And up the beach we bend our way.

CXXVII.  
When once I found my steed trod ground,  
I looked arouad on every side,  
Anxious for tidings small or great  
Of Finn and his state, once Erin's pride.

CXXVIII.  
Not long in doubt had I thus stayed  
When a cavalcade came up the way —  
Strange crowd, I thought, of women and men  
And past my ken their strange array.

CXXIX.  
Right gentlv they saluted me  
But marvell'd much to see my size,  
They marvell'd at my wondrous steed  
For on such breed they'd ne'er set eyes.

CXXX.  
I asked — with fear my heart within —  
If the noble Finn were yet alive,  
Or if his hosts that kept the coasts  
Of Erin safe, did yet survive.

CXXXI.  
" Of Finn, " they said, " we oft have heard —  
His name and fame are now world-wide,  
But full three hundred years have passed  
Since Finn and the last of the Fenians died.

CXXXII.  
" Many a book and many a tale  
Have bards of the Gael that treat of Finn —  
Of his strength and valour and wisdom bright  
Of his race of might and mighty kin.

CXXXIII.  
" We've also heard of Finn's great son—  
A youth of wondrous mien and mould,  
That a lady came hither from over the sea  
And with her went he to *Tír na n-Óg* "

CXXXIV.  
Now when those words fell on mine ear —  
That Finn and his heroes were no more —  
My heart was chilled — my soul was filled  
With woe unwilled ne'er felt before.

CXXXV.  
I stopped no longer upon my course  
But swift my horse urged onward flew —  
Till Alvin's hill o'er Leinster's plain  
Rose once again before my view.

CXXXVI.  
What shock I felt none could report,  
To see the court of Finn of the steeds  
A ruin lone, all overgrown  
With nettles and thorns and rankest weeds!

CXXXVIl.  
I found alas, 'twas a vain pursuít,  
A bootless, fruitless, visit mine !  
Great Finn was dead and the hosts he led  
For this I'd sped thro' ocean's brine !

CXXXVIIX.  
But let me tell my story all—  
Tho' Alvin's roofless hall I'd seen,  
I still would see spots dear to me  
Where Fenians free and Finn had been.

CXXXIX.  
In passing through the Thrushes' Glen  
A crowd of men in straits I see,  
Full thrice five score and haply more  
At toil full sore awaited me.

CXL.  
Then forth there spoke a man of that herd  
With suppliant word to me address'd —  
" Come to our help, O champion brave,  
Come quick to save us thus distress'd ! "

CXLI.  
I rode up briskly to the crowd  
And found them bow'd beneath a weight—  
A flag of marble great and long  
Bore down the throng who moaned their fate.

CXLII.  
Now all who tried to lift that stone  
Did pant and groan most piteously —  
Till some its crushing weight drove mad  
And some fell dead, most sad to see !

CXLIII.  
Then cried a steward of that crowd  
And said aloud, " O haste and hie,  
O gallant knight to our relief  
Or else 'tis brief ere all shall die ! "

CXLIV.  
"A shameful thing it is to say —  
For such array of men these days —  
They're powerless of blood and bone  
Full easily that stone to raise ! "

CXLV.  
" If Oscar, Oisín's valiant son  
Laid hold upon that marble stone  
With right hand bare he'd hurl't in air  
Flinging it fair, with ne'er a groan ! "

CXLVI.  
Asked thus for help I did not lag  
Bur 'neath the flag I placed one hand —  
Full perches seven that stone I hurl  
And scare each churl in all that band !

CXLVII.  
But scarce alas ! that stone had passed  
With that fair cast when ah ! the strain —  
The strain it broke the white steed's girth,  
I fell to earth, doomed now to pain !

CXLVIII.  
No sooner had I touched the ground  
Than with abound my steed took fright —  
Away, away, to the west he rushed !  
Whilst all stood hush'd at such strange sight !

CXLIX.  
At once I lose the sight of my eyes,  
My youth's bloom dies, lean age began,  
And I was left of strength bereft  
A helpless, hopeless, blind old man l

CL.  
O Patrick, now the tale thou hast,  
As each thing passed, indeed, in truth,  
My going away, my lengthened stay,  
And return for aye from the Land of Youth !  
Thus far the Lay of Oisín in the Land of Youth.
