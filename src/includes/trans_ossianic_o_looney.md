LAY OF OISIN ON THE LAND OF YOUTHS;  

AS HE RELATED IT TO SAINT PATRICK.  

P. O ! Noble Oisin, O ! son of the king !  
Of greatest actions, valor, and conflicts,  
Belate to us now without despondency,  
How thou livedst after the Fians?  

O. I will tell it thee, O Patrick ! lately arrived,  
Though mournful to me to say it aloud:—  
"After the hard battle of Gabhra,  
In which was killed, alas ! the noble Oscar.  

One day we, the Fianna, were all assembled,  
Generous Fionn and all of us that lived were there;  
Tho' dark and mournful was our story,  
After our heroes being overcome.  

We were hunting on a misty morning  
Nigh the bordering shores of Loch Léin,  
Where thro' fragrant trees of sweetest blossoms,  
And the mellow music of birds at all times.  

We aroused the hornless deer  
Of the best bounding, course, and agility;  
Our hounds and all our dogs  
Were close after in full chase.  

`[Garristown in the county of Dublin. See the Introduction to Vol. I. of the TranBactions of the Osaianic Society, also the note from Mr. J. Reid in same book, page 112. *Gabbra* is not Garristown, but a stream which flows into the Boyne, not far from the hill of Skreen, near Tarn, in the Countj of Meath. J. O'D. *Loch Líen*, the old Irish name of the l4ikca of Killarney in the oounty  
of Kerry.]`  

O. 'Twas not long 'till we saw, westwards,  
A fleet rider advancing towards us,  
A young maiden of most beautiful appearance.  
On a slender white steed of swiftest power.  

We all ceased firom the chase,  
On seeing the form of the royal maid;  
'Twas a surprise to Fionn and the Fianns,  
They never beheld a woman equal in beauty.  

A royal crown was on her head;  
And a brown mantle of precious silk.  
Spangled with stars of red gold,  
Covering her shoes down to the grass.  

A gold ring was hanging down  
From each yellow curl `[Perhaps flguratitvely meaning that snch curl was like a loop of gold.]` of her golden hair;  
Her eyes blue, clear, and cloudless,  
Like a dew drop on the top of the grass.  

Redder were her cheeks than the rose,  
Fairer was her visage than the swan upon the wave,  
And more sweet was the taste of her balsam lips  
Than honey mingled thro' red wine.  

A garment wide, long, and smooth.  
Covered the white steed;  
There was a comely saddle of red gold,  
And her right hand held a bridle with a golden bit.  

Four shoes well shaped were under him,  
Of the yellow gold of the purest quality;  
A silver wreath was on the back of his head.  
And there was not in the world a steed better.  

O. She came to the presence of Fionn,  
And spoke with a voice sweet and gentle,  
And she said, "O, king of the Fianna,  
Long and distant is my journey, now."  

F. "Who art thou, thyself, O youthful princess !  
Of fairest form, beauty, and countenance,  
Relate to us the cause of thy story,  
Thine own name and thy country."  

"Golden-headed Niamh is my name,  
0, sage Fionn of the great hosts.  
Beyond the women of the world I have won esteem,  
I am the fair daughter of the King of Youth."  

F. "Relate to us O amiable princess  
What caused thee to come afar across the sea—  
Is it thy consort has forsaken thee,  
Or what is the affliction that is on thyself."  

N. "'Tis not my husband that went from me,  
And as yet I have not been spoken of with any man, `[i.e. I have not been betrothed to any man]`  
O ! king of the Fianna of highest repute,  
But affection and love I have given to thy son."  

"Which of my children [is he] O blooming daughter.  
To whom thou hast given love, or yet affection—  
Do not conceal from us now the cause,  
And relate to us thy case, O woman."  

"I will tell thee that, O Fionn !  
Thy noble son of the well-tempered arms,  
High-spirited Oisin of the powerfdl bands,  
Is the champion that I am now speaking of."  

O. "What is the reason that thou gavest love.  
O ! beautiful daughter of the glossy hair,  
To my own son beyond all,  
And multitudes of high lords under the sun."  

"'Tis not without cause, O, king of the Fianna !  
I came afar for him—  
But reports I heard of his prowess,  
The goodness of his person and his mien."  

"Many a son of a king and a high chief  
Gave me affection and perpetual love;  
I never consented to any man  
'Till I gave love to noble Oisin."  

"By that hand on thee, O Patrick,  
Though it is not shameful to me as a story.  
There was not a limb of me but was in love  
With the beautiful daughter of the glossy hair."  

I took her hand in mine.  
And said in speech of sweetest tone,  
"A true, gentle, welcome before thee,  
O young princess to this country !"  

"'Tis thou that art the brightest and the fairest of form,  
'Tis thee I prefer as wife  
Thou art my choice beyond the women of the world  
O mild star of loveliest countenance !"  

"Obligations unresisted by true heroes  
O generous Oisin I put upon thee  
To come with myself now upon my steed  
Till we arrive at the ' Land of Youth.'  

O. "It is the most delightful country to be found,  
Of greatest repute under the sun  
Trees drooping with fruit and blossom  
And foliage growing on the tops of boughs.  

"Abundant, there, are honey and wine  
And everything that eye has beheld,  
There will not come decline on thee with lapse of time,  
Death or decay thou wilt not see.  

"Thou wilt get feasts, playing, and drink,  
Thou wilt get melodious music on the harp strings,  
Thou wilt get silver and gold,  
Thou wilt get also many jewels.  

"Thou wilt get, without falsehood, a hundred swords;  
Thou wilt get a hundred satin garments of precious silk,  
Thou wilt get a hundred horses the swiftest in conflict.  
And thou wilt get a hundred with them of keen hounds.  

"Thou wilt get the royal diadem of the ' King of Youth,'  
Which he never yet gave to any person under the sun,  
'Twill protect thee both night and day,  
In battle, in tumult, and in rough conflict.  

"Thou wilt get a fitting coat of protecting mail  
And a gold headed sword apt for strokes,  
From which no person ever escaped alive  
Who, once, saw the sharp weapon.  

"Thou wilt get a hundred coats of armour and shirts of satin,  
Thou wilt get a hundred cows and, also, an hundred calves,  
Thou wilt get a hundred sheep, with their golden fleeces,  
Thou wilt get a hundred jewels not in this world.  

O. "Thou wilt get a hundred virgins gay and young  
Blight, refulgent, like the sun.  
Of best fonn, shape, and appearance,  
Whose voices are sweeter than the music of birds.  

"Thou wilt get a hundred heroes most powerful in conflict,  
And also most expert in feats of agility,  
In arms and armour waiting on thee  
In the ' Land of Youth' if thou wilt come with me.  

"Thou will get everything I promised thee `[+ Every verse with this mark (+) is taken from a MS. which I lately got, and was not in the MS. transcribed for the president or in Mr. Griffin's copy.]`  
And delights, also, which I may not mention.  
Thou wilt get beauty, strength, and power,  
And I myself will be thy wife."  

"No refusal will I give from me,  
charming queen of the golden curls !  
Thou art my choice above the women of the world,  
And I will go, with willingness, to the 'Land of  
Youth.'"  

On the back of the steed we went together,  
Before me sat the virgin;  
. She said: "Oisin let us remain quiet,  
Till we reach the mouth of the great sea."  

Then arose the steed swiftly,  
When we arrived on the borders of the strand  
He shook himself then to pace forward.  
And neighed three times aloud.  

When Fionn and the Fianna saw.  
The steed travelling swiftly.  
Facing against the great tide.  
They raised three shouts of mourning and grief.  

O. "O Oisin!" said Fionn slowly and sorrowfully,  
"Woe it is to me that thou art going from me,  
I have not a hope that thou wilt ever again.  
Come back to me victorious."  

His form and beauty changed,  
And showers of tears flowed down,  
Till they wet his breast and his bright visage  
And he said, "My woe art thou, O, Oisin! in going  
from me."  

O Patrick, 'twas a melancholy story  
Our parting from each other in that place.  
The parting of the father from his own son—  
'Tis mournful, weak, and faint to be relating it !  

I kissed my father sweetly and gently,  
And the same affection I got from him;  
I bade adieu to all the Fianna,  
And the Tears flowed down my cheeks.  

Many a delightful day had Fionn and I,  
And the Fianna with us in great power,  
Been chess-playing and drinking,  
And hearing music—the host that was powerful !  

A hunting in smooth valleys.  
And our sweet-mouthed dogs with us there;  
At other times, in the rough conflict,  
Slaughtering heroes with great vigour.  

P. O ! foolish Oisin, forego a while  
Thy great actions of the Fenians,  
How didst thou go to the "Land of Youth,"  
Proceed, faithfully, with thy tale to us.  

O. We turned our backs to the land  
And our faces directly due-west.  
The smooth sea ebbed before us,  
And filled in billows after us.  

We saw wonders in our travels,  
Cities, courts and castles,  
Lime-white mansions and fortresses.  
Brilliant summer-houses and palaces.  

We saw also, by our sides  
A hornless fawn leaping nimbly,  
And a red-eared white dog,  
Urging it boldly in the chase.  

We beheld also, without fiction,  
A young maid on a brown steed,  
A golden apple in her right hand,  
And she going on the top of the waves.  

We saw after her,  
A young rider on a white steed.  
Under a purple, crimson mantle of satin.  
And a gold-headed sword in his right hand,  

"Who are yon two whom I see,  
O gentle princess, tell me the meaning,  
That woman of most beautiful countenance,  
And the comely rider of the white steed."  

"Heed not what thou wilt see,  
O gentle Oisin, nor what thou hast yet seen.  
There is in them but nothing,  
Till we reach the land of the 'King of Youth.'"  

O. We saw from us afar  
A sunny palace of beautiful front,  
Its form and appearance were the most beauteous  
That were to be found in the world"  

"What exceeding—fine, royal mansion,  
And also, the best that eye hath seen,  
Is this, that we are travelling near to.  
Or who is high-chief of that place?"  

"The daughter of the king of the ' Land of Life,'  
Is queen, yet, in that fortress  
She was taken by Fomhor Builleach `[Fomhor Builleach, i.e. the striking Giant, was the despotic ruler of the "Land of Virtues," — a country not mentioned in any other copy of this poem that I have seen.]`, of Dromloghach,  
With violent strength of arms and activity.  

"Obligation she put upon the brave,  
Never to make her a wife,  
Till she got a champion or true hero.  
To stand battle with him hand to hand."  

"Take success and blessings, O golden-headed Niamh,  
I have never heard better music  
Than the gentle voice of thy sweet mouth,  
Great grief to us is a woman of her condition.  

"I will go now to visit her to the fortress.  
And it may be for us it is fated  
That that great hero should fall by me.  
In feats of activity as is wont to me."  

We went then into the fortress.  
To us came the youthful queen.  
Equal in splendor was she to the sun.  
And she bade us a hundred welcomes.  

O. There was apparel of yellow silk  
On the queen of excelling beauty,  
Her chalk-white skin was like the swan on the wave,  
And her cheeks were of the colour of the rose.  

Her hair was of a golden hue.  
Her blue eyes clear and cloudless;  
Her honey lips of the colour of the berries,  
And her slender brows of loveliest form.  

Then we there sat down,  
Each of us on a chair of gold,  
There was laid out for us abundance of food  
And drinking-horns filled with beoir [`Although this word resemble the word "beer," the liquors were very different]`.  

When we had taken a sufficiency of food,  
And much sweet drinking wines,  
Then spoke the mild young princess.  
And thus said she, "harken to me awhile."  

She told us the knowledge and cause of her tale.  
And the tears flowed down her cheeks;  
She said, "my return is not to my own country.  
Whilst the great giant shall be alive."  

"Be silent, O young princess !  
Give o'er thy grief and do not mourn,  
And I give to thee my hand  
That the giant of slaughter shall fall by me !"  

"There's not a champion now to be found  
Of greatest repute under the sun,  
To give battle hand to hand  
To the bold giant of the bard blows."  

O. "I tell to thee, O gentle queen,  
I am not daunted at his coming to meet me.  
Unless he fall by me, by the strength of my arms,  
I will fall myself in thy defence."  

'Twas not long till we saw approaching  
The powerful giant that was most disgusting,  
A load was on him of the skins of deer,  
And an iron bar in his hand.  

He did not salute or bow to us,  
But looked into the countenance of the young maiden,  
Proclaimed battle and great conflict,  
And I went myself to meet him.  

During three nights and three days  
We were in the great contest,  
Though powerful was he, the valiant giant,  
I beheaded him without delay.  

When the two young maidens saw  
The great giant, lying motionless, weak and low,  
They uttered three joyfiil cries,  
With great boasting and merriment.  

We then went to the fortress.  
And I was bruised, weak and feeble,  
Shedding blood in great abundance.  
Coming closely out of my wounds.  

The daughter of the "King of the Living" came  
In truth to relieve myself;  
She put balm and balsam, in my wounds,  
And I was whole after her.  

O. We consumed our feast with pleasure,  
And then we were merry after,  
In the fortress were prepared for us,  
Warm beds of the down of birds.  

We buried the great man  
In a deep sod-grave, wide and clear,  
I raised his flag and monument,  
And I wrote his name in Ogham Craobh.  

On the morrow, at the appearance of day.  
We awoke out of our slumbers,  
"It is time for us," said the daughter of the king,  
"To go without delay to our own land."  

We prepared ourselves without a stay.  
And we took our leave of the virgin.  
We were sorrowful and sad after her.  
And not less after us was the refulgent maid.  

I do not know, O mild Patrick !  
What occurred to the young princess.  
Since the day we both parted her.  
Or whether she herself returned to the Land of Life.  

P. Thou didst not tell us, O pleasant Oisin,  
What country it is in which thou wast thyself;  
Reveal to us now its name.  
And continue again the track of thy story.  

O. That country is the "Land of Virtues,"  
And certainly the name is not miscalled,  
If heaven hath glories as were there,  
To God, with love, I would give praise.  

O. We turned our backs on the fortress,  
And our horse under us in full speed.  
And swifter was the white steed.  
Than March wind on the mountain summit.  

Ere long the sky darkened,  
And the wind arose in every point.  
The great sea lit up strongly,  
And sight of the sun was not to be found !  

We gazed awhile on the clouds,  
And on the stars that were under gloom  
The tempest abated and the wind,  
And Phoebus brightened o'er our heads.  

We beheld by our side,  
A most delightful country under full bloom,  
And plains, beautiful, smooth and fine,  
And a royal fortress of surpassing beauty.  

Not a colour that eye has beheld  
Of rich blue, green, and white,  
Of purple, crimson, and of yellow.  
But was in this royal mansion that I am describing.  

There were at the other side of the fortress,  
Radiant summer-houses and palaces,  
Made, all of precious stones,  
By the hands of skilful men and great artists.  

Ere long we saw approaching  
From the fortress to meet us.  
Three fifties of champions of best agility,  
Appearance, fame and of highest repute.  

O. "What beauteous country is that  
O gentle daughter of the golden locks !  
Of best aspect that the eye has seen,  
Or is it the ' Land of Youth?"  

"It is, truly, O generous Oisin !  
I have not told a lie to you concerning it,  
There is nothing I promised thyself  
But is manifest to thee for ever."  

To us, came after that  
A hundred maids of exquisite beauty.  
Under garments of silk filled with gold,  
Welcoming me to their own country.  

We saw again approaching,  
A multitude of glittering bright host,  
And a noble great and powerful king,  
Of matchless grace, form and countenance.  

There was a yellow shirt of silken satin  
And a bright golden garment over it.  
There was a sparkling crown of gold.  
Radiant and shining upon his head.  

We saw coming after him  
The young queen of highest repute;  
And fifty virgins sweet and mild,  
Of most beautiftil form in her company.  

When all arrived in one spot.  
Then courteously spoke the "King of Youth,"  
And said, "This is Oisin the son of Fionn,  
The gentle consort of 'Golden-headed Niamh!'"  

O. He took me then by the hand,  
And said, [aloud to the hearing of] the host,  
"O, brave Oisin ! O, son of the king !  
A hundred thousand welcomes to you !"  

"This country into which thou comest,  
I'll not conceal its tidings from you, in truth,  
Long and durable is your life.  
And thou thyself shalt be ever young."  

There's not a delight on which the heart hath mused  
But is in this land awaiting thee;  
O ! Oisin believe me in truth,  
For I am king of the ' Land of Youth !'  

"This is the gentle Queen,  
And my own daughter the Golden-headed Niamh,  
Who went over the smooth seas for thee  
To be her consort for ever."  

I gave thanks to the King,  
And I bowed down to the gentle Queen,  
Nor staid we there, [but proceeded] soon,  
Till we reached the royal mansion of the "King of Youth."  

There came the nobles of the fine fortress.  
Both men and women to meet us;  
There was a feast and banquet continuously there.  
For ten nighta and ten days.  

I espoused "Golden-headed Niamh,"  
O ! Patrick from Rome of white croziers!  
That is how I went to the "Land of Youth,"  
Tho' woeful and grievous to me to relate.  

P. Continue for us further thy tale,  
O golden Oisin of the slaying arms!  
How didst thou leave the "Land of youth,"  
I, yet, think it long till you reveal the cause.  

Tell to us now with great pleasure,  
Hadst thou any children by Niamh,  
Or how long wert thou in the "Land of Youth,'  
Relate to us, without grief, thy story,  

O. I had by Golden-headed Niamh,  
Of children of surpassing beauty and bloom.  
Of best form, shape, and countenance.  
Two young sons and a gentle daughter.  

I spent a time protracted in length,  
Three hundred years and more,  
Until I thought 'twould be my desire  
To see Fionn and the Fianna alive.  

P. pleasant Oisin continue thy story.  
And tell us where are thy children;  
Give us, without delay, their names.  
And the land in which they are.  

O. Niamh had awaiting them.  
The Land of Youth— the Land of Life, and the land of Virtues:  
A wreath and crown of the kingly gold.  
And many jewels I do not mention.  

Niamh gave to my two sons  
The names of my father and of my good son,  
Noble Fionn — head of the hosts —  
And Osgar of the red golden arms.  

O. I, myself, gave to my gentle daughter,  
By consent of golden-headed Niamh,  
In virtue of her beauty and loving countenance.  
The true name — Plur-na-mban [the flower of  
women.]  

I asked leave of the king,  
And of my kind spouse — golden-headed Niamh,  
To go to Erinn back again,  
To see Fionn and his great host.  

"Thou wilt get leave from me,' said the gentle daughter,  
"Though 'tis a sorrowftil tale to me to hear you mention it,  
Lest thou mayest not come again in your life  
To my own land, victorious Oisin!"  

"What do we dread, blooming Queen!  
Whilst the white steed is at my service,  
He'll teach me the way with ease,  
And will return safe back to thyself."  

"Remember Oisin ! what I am saying,  
If thou layest feot on level ground,  
Thou shalt not come again for ever  
To this fine land in which I am myself.  

"I say to thee again without guile,  
If thou alightest once off the white steed.  
Thou wilt never more come to the ' Land of Youth,'  
golden Oisin of the warlike arms !  

"I say to thee for the third time,  
If thou alightest off the steed thyself.  
That thou wilt be an old man, withered, and blind.  
Without activity, without pleasure, without run,  
without leap.  

O. "'Tis a woe to me, loving Oisin,  
That thou ever goest to green Erinn;  
'Tis not now as it has been;  
And thou never shalt see Fionn of the hosts.  

"There is not now in all Erin,  
But a father of orders and hosts of saints;  
O loving Oisin ! here is my kiss,  
Thou wilt never return to the ' Land of Youth !'"  

I looked up into her countenance with compassion,  
And streams of tears ran from my eyes,  
O Patrick ! thou wouldst have pitied her  
Tearing the hair off the golden head.  

She put me under strict injunctions  
To go and come without touching the lea,  
And said to me by virtue of their power,  
If I broke them that I'd never return safe;  

I promised her each thing, without a lie,  
That I would fulfil what she said to me;  
I went on the back of the white steed  
And bade farewell to the people of the fortress.  

I kissed my gentle consort.  
And sorrowful was I in parting from her,  
My two sons, and my young daughter  
Were under grief, shedding tears.  

I prepared myself for travelling.  
And I turned my back on the "Land of Youth,"  
The steed ran swiftly under me,  
As he had done with me and "golden-headed Niamh."  

O. Our story is not told in full,  
Of every thing that occurred to myself,  
Until I came again back  
To green Erin of the many jewels.  

O Patrick of the orders and of the saints,  
I never yet told you a falsehood.  
There is to thee the reason of my story.  
And how I left the "Land of Youth."  

If I myself had been, O Patrick !  
As I was, that self-same day,  
I would put thy clerics all to death.  
And a head on a neck would not be after me.  

If I got plenty of the bread  
As I used to get, at all times, from Fionn,  
I would pray to the king of grace  
To have thee safe, over it.  

P. Thou wilt get bread and drink,  
Without any fault now from myself,  
Melodious to me is the voice of thy mouth,  
And continue for us still thy story.  

O. On my coming, then, into the country,  
I looked closely in every direction,  
I thought then in truth  
That the tidings of Fionn were not to be found.  

Twas not long for me nor tedious,  
Till I saw from the west approaching me,  
A great troop of mounted men and women,  
And they came into my own presence.  

O. They saluted me kindly and courteously,  
And surprise seized every one of them,  
On seeing the bulk of my own person,  
My form, my appearance, and my countenance.  

I myself asked then of them,  
Did they hear if Fionn was alive,  
Or did any one else of the Fianna live,  
Or what disaster had swept them away?  

"We have heard tell of Fionn,  
For strength, for activity, and for prowess,  
That there never was an equal for him  
In person, in character, and in mien.  

There is many a book written down,  
By the melodious sweet sages of the Gaels,  
Which we in truth, are unable to relate to thee.  
Of the deeds of Fioim and of the Fianna."  

We heard that Fionn had  
A son of brightest beauty and form,  
That there came a young maiden for him  
And that he went with her to the "Land of Youth."  

When I myself heard that announcement,  
That Fionn did not live or any of the Fianna,  
I was seized with weariness and great sorrow,  
And I was full of melancholy after them !  

I did not stop on my course,  
Quick and smart without any delay,  
Till I set my face straightforward  
To Almhuin of great exploits in broad Leinster.  

O. Great was my surprise there,  
That I did not not see the court of Fionn of the hosts;  
There was not in its place in truth  
But weeds, chick-weeds, and nettles.  

Alas, Patrick ! and alas, my grief!  
A miserable journey it was to me,  
Without the tidings of Fionn or the Fianna;  
It left me through life under pain.  

P. O Oisin ! now desist from thy grief,  
Shed thy tears to the God of Grace,  
Fionn and the Fianna are weak enough,  
And relief is not theirs for ever.  

O. That would be a great pity, O Patrick!  
That Fionn should be in pain, for ever;  
Or what pursuers gained victory over him.  
Since many a hardy hero fell by himself.  

P. It is God who gained victory over Fionn,  
And not the strength of enemy or strong hand,  
And over all the Fianna like him,  
Condemned to hell, they are eternally tormented.  

O, Patrick ! direct me into the place  
In which Fionn is in hands and the Fianna,  
And there is not a hell or a heaven there  
That will put them under subjection.  

If Osgar my own son be there.  
The hero that was bravest in heavy conflict,  
There is not created in hell, or in the Heaven of God  
A host tho' great, that he would not destroy.  

P. Let us leave off our controversy on each side  
And continue thy story, O valiant Oisin!  
What occurred to thee after that,  
Subsequently to the Fianna being low.  

O. I, myself will tell thee that, O Patrick!—  
After I left Almhuin of Leinster,  
There was not a residence where the Fianna had been,  
But I searched accurately without any delay.  

On my passing thro' the glen of the thrushes `[the valley of the thrush, now anglicized Glenasmole.]`,  
I saw a great assembly there,  
Three hundred men and more  
Were before me in the glen.  

One of the assembly spoke,  
And he said with a loud voice:  
"Come to our relief, kingly champion;  
And deliver us from difficulty !"  

I, then came forward.  
And the host had a large flag of marble,  
The weight of the flag was down on them.  
And to uphold it, they were unable !  

Those that were under the flag below,  
Were being oppressed, weakly.  
By the weight of the great load  
Many of them lost their senses.  

One of the stewards spoke  
And said:— "O princely young hero!  
Forthwith relieve my host,  
Or not one of them will be alive."  

O. 'Tis a shameful deed, that it should now be said,  
And the number of men that is there,  
That the strength of the host is unable  
To lift the flag with great power.  

If Oscar the son of Oisin lived,  
He would take this flag in his right hand,  
He would fling it in a throw over the host—  
It is not my custom to speak falsehood.  

I lay upon my right breast,  
And I took the flag in my hand,  
With the strength and activity of my limbs  
I sent it seven perches `[1 perch = 16 1/2 feet]` from its place !  

With the force of the very large flag,  
The golden girth broke on the white steed;  
I came down full suddenly,  
On the soles of my two feet on the lea.  

No sooner did I come down.  
Than the white steed took fright,  
He went then on his way,  
And I, in sorrow, both weak and feeble.  

I lost the sight of my eyes,  
My form, my countenance, and my vigour,  
I was an old man, poor and blind,  
Without strength, understanding, or esteem.  

Patrick I there is to thee my story,  
As it occurred to myself without a lie,  
My going and my adventures in certain.  
And my returning from the "Land of Youth."
