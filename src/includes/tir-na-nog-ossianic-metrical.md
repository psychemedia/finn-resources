LAY OF OISIN ON THE LAND OF YOUTH, AS RELATED BY HIM TO ST. PATRICK.  

P. O brave Oisin ! son of the king !  
Of valorous deeds and actions greatest;  
I pray, and sadness from thee fling,  
How yet thou liv'st that thou relatest.  

O. New Patrick, I will tell, tho' sore,  
To tell it thee, and great the trouble  
The battle dread of Garva o'er,  
Where fell alas ! the Osgar noble.  

One day as we assembled were,  
Generous Finn and all surviving,  
Though mournful is our tale and drear,  
In death our gallant heroes leaving.  

The borders of Lough Lene along,  
As *there* we coursed in misty morning,  
The woods afloat with birds' sweet song,  
And trees and flowers the place adorning.  

There we aroused the hornless deer,  
Of swiftest foot and lightest bounding,  
Our brindled hounds close in the rear,  
The nimble animal astounding.  

It was not long till we espied,  
A rider fleet towards us advancing;  
A lily-gleaming lovely maid,  
On a swift palfry graceful prancing.  

Then from the chase we all did cease,  
To a royal maid it was our duty;  
And Finn and we did all agree,  
We ne'er beheld an equal beauty.  

A regal crown adorned her head,  
Her flowing robes of silk most precious,  
Spangled with stars bright golden-red,  
Loose trailed in glittering folds and spacious.  

Were golden ringlets dangling down,  
Each curling tress as bright and golden,  
Her eyes clear blue withouten frown,  
Like morning dew drops pure beholden.  

Her cheeks were like the unfolding rose,  
More graceful she than swan light-swimming,  
The nectar her red lips dispose,  
Sweeter than sweetest goblets brimming.  

Rich were the housings, gorgeous, grand,  
That covered her steed the fleetest, whitest,  
The saddle pure gold, and in her hand,  
A gold-bit bridle, rarest, brightest.  

Four shoes well-shaped he stood upon,  
Of yellow gold of sheen the fairest,  
His head a silver wreath was on,  
Of breathing steeds is he the rarest.  

O. Full soon to Finn she did repair,  
In accents gentle graceful speaking,  
" Brave Fenian king," thus spoke the fair,  
"Afar I've come thy heroes seeking. "  

F. " Lady, from us conceal not now,  
(Of loveliest countenance and meekest,)  
Whence thou hast come and who art thou,  
And what it is thou lonely seekest."  

"Gold-head Niamh is my name,  
O sagest Finn of far famed legions,  
Beyond all women is my fame,  
The Princess of the Youthful Regions. "  

"Then, Princess bright, relate to us,  
What afiliction thy bosom presses,  
That thy own home thou leavest thus  
Has consort thine fled thy caresses ? "  

" Not husband mine from me did go,  
Nor am I yet to man bespoken;  
But famous king of Fenians know  
Of love to thy son, this the token. "  

"Which of my sons is he whom thou  
Hast loved so well, O daughter blooming ?  
Let thy narration freely flow  
And true concealing nought, sweet woman.  

"To thee, brave Finn, I'll truly tell,  
Thy noble son of spirits cheering,  
Oisin — of arms high tempered well,  
The cause of this my speech thou’rt hearing. "  

F. "What is the reason thou'lt assign,  
O'er lords that live — of scores the many,  
My son thou lov'st — of ringlets fine,  
Daughter more beautiful than any ? "  

L. " Brave Fenian king, not without cause  
From lands afar I'm thus a roving,  
For of his might I've heard applause,  
And of himself accounts approving.  

"Full many a Prince and Chieftain high,  
Are there that loved me with affection,  
But none to love consented I  
Till now Oisin of noblest action. "  

O. O Patrick by that hand on thee,  
Nor shameful do I deem the telling,  
In love was every limb of me,  
With that sweet maid of ringlets swelling.  

O. In mine I took her lovely hand  
And said in tones of speech so sweet, " thee  
I gladly welcome to this land,  
And gentle, truly, do I greet thee.  

"I bless the happy gladsome hour  
On which I met thee, lovely creature,  
All living maids, I prize thee o'er,  
Thou gentle star of radiant feature. "  

L. " Gen'rous Oisin I bind on thee  
By ties no bero true resisteth,  
Now on my steed to come with me,  
To th' land where youth for ever existeth.  

L. "The most delightful to be found,  
And of most gen'rous reputation,  
With fruit trees drooping to the ground,  
And verdure there without cessation.  

"Honey abundant there and wine,  
And all that to the eyes are grateful,  
Nor shalt thou see age nor decline,  
Decay so bald nor death so hateful.  

"Feasts, manly sports, and music sweet  
Of harpchords most melodious chanting,  
And gold and silver, thou shalt get,  
Nor costly jewels shall be wanting.  

"And richest suit, believe my words,  
Of costly silk, and steeds the finest,  
An hundred each, and glittering swords,  
Thou'lt have, and hounds of scent the keenest.  

"The king of youths' diadem thou'lt get,  
In dangers safe I'll keep thee ever,  
For any person living yet,  
This diadem he parted never.  

"A closely fitting coat of mail,  
Thy person from all strokes protecting,  
A gold hilt sword that ne'er did fail,  
Death to all foes at once inflicting.  

Shirts, armour, kine, an hundred each,  
And calves and sheep with golden fleeces, —  
This world did never witness such,  
As jewels thou'lt get an hundred pieces.  

O. "An hundred virgins gay and young,  
Refulgent as the sun appearing,  
Of comeliest forms, — ne'er like them sung,  
The sweetest birds, their voice so cheering.  

"An hundred heroes shall be thine,  
In speed and feats of strength excelling,  
In arms and armour bright they shine,  
If the Land of Youth thou'lt make thy dwelling.  

"All I have promised thou'lt receive,  
Besides delights I may not mention;  
A life of happiness believe,  
With me thy wife of sweet attention. "  

"Refusal none from me thou'lt get,  
Bright queen of amber ringlets flowing,  
The choice of all I ever met,  
To the Land of Youth let us be going. "  

On the steed's back before me still,  
The virgin sate, without emotion,  
" Behave thyself, " she said " until  
We reach the shore of yonder ocean. "  

At once arose the swiftest steed,  
When we the ocean's shore had bordered,  
And shook himself and three times neighed,  
A preparation to face forward.  

When Finn and all the Fenii saw,  
The sturdy steed so swiftly journeying.  
And close upon the ocean draw  
They raised three shouts of grief and mourning.  

"Alas, " said Finn, " woe is to me,  
That thou art thus me lonely leaving,  
Whom bravely I ne'er hope to see,  
Returning," spoke Finn slow and grieving.  

This form and beauty changed at sight,  
And tears ran down in showers flowing,  
And wet his breast and visage bright,  
"My woe ! " said he,"Oisin is going ! " '  

Our parting from each other then,  
Patrick, the son and father hoary—  
Without a hope to meet again,  
Oh ! 'tis a melancholy story.  

My father did I gently kiss,  
Receiving from him the same affection,  
And down my cheeks did round tears press,  
Adieu to bid that gallant faction !  

Delightful days spent Finn and I,  
And with us all the Fenii gallant,  
And oft at chess our skill did try,  
And manly sports — that host once valiant !  

In valleys deep a hunting gay,  
Our dogs of music-mouth sweet yelling;  
At other times in war array,  
With vigour heroes lifeless felling.  

P. Foolish Oisin, awhile forego  
Thy Fenian bravery elating,  
How tis thou went we long to know,  
Then continue thy tale relating.  

O. We turned our backs upon the land,  
And right due-west our faces willing,  
The sea ebbing before us, and  
After we passed the dry space filling.  

And many wonders saw we there —  
Cities and courts and mansions whitest,  
Fortresses too, and castles fair,  
Palaces and summer seats the brightest.  

We by our sides had seen also  
A harmless fawn quite nimbly leaping;  
A red-eared hound as white as snow,  
A sprightly chace after her keeping.  

We saw — nor is it idly planned—  
A maiden young a brown steed riding,  
A golden apple in her hand,  
On the wave tops green she passed us sliding.  

After the maiden bounded fast,  
A youthful rider costly clothed,  
In crimson mantle of sun-red cast,—  
Gold-hilt sword he held unsheathed.  

Of yonder twain whom yet I see,  
O princess mild reveal the mystery;  
Of the white steed's rider pray tell me,  
And comely maiden too, the history.  

L. Heed not, Oisin, what thou dost see,  
Nor wonder thou at any vision,  
In them is nothing until we  
Have reached the Land of Youth elysian.  

O. A sun-bright palace next appeared,  
Of noblest shape on the horizon,  
A shining front on high it reared,  
More beautiful were not set eyes on.  

What royal mansion grand is this  
Great lasting wonder architectural ?  
Say also who its ruler is,  
Say I pray thee leave me not conjectural.  

The Princess of the Land of Life,  
Is in that fortress yet forsaken;  
With violent strength of armed strife,  
By Fowar Builteach of Dromlough taken.  

She, never to make her his wife,  
Upon the brave put obligation;  
Until with deeds of heroic strife,  
Some champion gained her liberation.  

Blessings be ever on thee shed,  
Sweeter thy voice than best musician,  
Sweet Niav of the golden head—  
Great is our grief at her condition.  

Come to the fortress her to see,  
And then despite his best endeavour,  
That giant great shall fall by me,  
In feats of strength as mine were ever.  

Into the fortress then we went,  
And the young princess came to greet us,  
To her beaming face our way we bent,  
With many welcomes did she meet us.  

O. Apparel of yellow silk was on  
The queen of beauty rare excelling,  
Her skin as white as any swan,  
Her cheeks surpass the poet's telling.  

Her hair fair shone, a golden hue,  
Her eyes clear blue were purely beaming,  
As berries her honeyed lips to view,  
Her browslike heaven's arch radiant gleaming.  

On soft arm chairs of glinting gold,  
We sat before a sumptuous table,  
Which flasks and viands did copious hold,  
Of nectarine *beoir* so sweet and sable.  

And when much wines sweet-flavoured, and  
Refreshment else, we all had taken,  
Then spoke the mild young Princess bland,  
And bade us to her story hearken.  

The secrets of her tale she told Us,  
and the tears came freely flowing,  
She said, " while livest the giant bold,  
To my own home I can't be going. "  

" Be silent, fair young Princess, and  
Give up thy mourning and thy grieving;  
For here I pledge to thee my hand,  
The giant shall not long be living. "  

" There is not a champion in the land,  
Of best repute the bright sun under,  
That could give battle hand to hand,  
To th' giant of the blows of thunder. "  

O. " Assure thyself, I promise thee  
That I am not in dread to try him,  
And if that he fall not by me,  
In thy defence I will fall by him. "  

Ere long we saw approaching near,  
The hideous giant, him did environ,  
A weighty load of skins of deer,  
— And in his hand a club of iron.  

Most rudely did he pass us by,  
At the young damsel looking coldly,  
Fierce conflict he proclaimed, and I  
Myself, to meet him, stalked forth boldly.  

Three days and nights we fiercely fought  
In contest great without abating,  
And then I to the ground him brought,  
His head and trunk first separating.  

And when the maidens saw him low,  
And that to Hades dark was he sent,  
Their gladness they did not forego,  
But gave it vent in gay merriment.  

Our way we backwards slowly bent,  
For weak was I — my strength quite losing,  
And shedding blood, for fast it went  
From out my wounds, most copious oozing.  

The Daughter of the King of Life  
In truth, to my assistance hasted,  
And cured the wounds that in the strife  
I got, nor longer strength I wasted.  

We on our feast with pleasure fared,  
And we were glad and merry after;  
For us were beds of down prepared,  
And warmer none could be, nor softer.  

The monster we interred, —the grave  
Was wide and deep in which I placed him;  
I wrote his name in Ogham Craobh,  
When tomb and tomb-stone high I raised him.  

Soon as the dawn auroral rose,  
And drowsiness fled each sensation,  
The Princess briskly did propose,  
That we'd set out to our destination.  

So we prepared ourselves in haste,  
Our leave of the young lady taking,  
And sorrow in each face was traced,  
As we each other were forsaking.  

O Patrick mild ! I cannot say  
What did occur to her, or whether  
To the Land of Life she made her way,  
For since we saw not one another.  

P. Pleasant Oisin, thou didst not tell  
What country 'twas which thou wert travelling  
Its name to us O pray reveal,  
And continue thy tale unravelling.  

O. The Land of Virtues is its name,  
And well's the appellation given,  
Your God with love I'd praise, if the same  
Glories as there are, be in heaven.  

O. Our faces homewards soon we turned,  
Our horse with us in full speed going,  
And swifter he the dull earth spurned,  
Than feet march winds over mountains blowing.  

The firmament frowned dark e'er long,  
With fury fierce the wind was blowing,  
The raging sea lashed wild and strong,  
The sun his bright face was not showing.  

Awhile amazed upon the clouds  
We gazed, that cloaked the stars thick under;  
The storm abated, and the shrouds  
Encircling Phoebus, split asunder.  

A most delightful country we  
Beheld close by, — were flowers blowing  
Along its plains exuberantly,  
And forts we saw their battlements showing.  

No colour ever eye has seen,  
Of richest blue or white the whitest,  
Of purple, crimson, yellow, green,  
But blending glimmered here the brightest.  

And plentiful all round were there  
Summer seats and palaces radiant,  
By skilful artist made they were  
Of precious stones without ingredient.  

Approached us slow in solemn throng,  
And welcomed us a deputation,  
One hundred and fifty champions strong,  
Of greatest speed and reputation.  

O. " What beautiful country, speak the truth,  
That eyes have any-where beholden—  
O say, is that the Land of Youth,  
Thou gentle maid of ringlets golden ? "  

" Generous Oisin, it is truly—  
A lie of it I told you never,  
Nor aught I promised e'er to thee,  
But certainly is thine for ever. '  

Approaching then did we behold  
An hundred beauteous maidens blooming,  
Their dresses dazzling bright with gold,  
To their blest country me welcoming.  

An escort multitudinous,  
Led by a king of might and power,  
Advanced and kindly welcomed us—  
Was manly grace his natal dower.  

And regal robes adorning bright,  
His beauteous person, flowed serenely,  
A crown of diamond-glowing light  
Twinkled upon his head so sheenly.  

And soon advanced the youthful Queen,  
By fifty lovely maids attended,  
Of nature's sweetest mould I ween,  
In whom the rose and lily blended.  

And being arrived where we were in,  
Thus spoke the King of Youths delighted :
" Behold, Oisin, brave son of Finn,  
To Niav his troth will soon be plighted. "  

O. He said, and loud his voice did ring,  
And clasped my hand,  
O friendship thro' thee,  
" O brave Oisin, son of the King,  
An hundred thousand welcomes to thee. "  

" Here in this Land where thou hast come,  
Solace thine heart with the happy tiding  
Thy life shall be a life of bloom,  
Long durable in youth abiding.  

"For in this golden Land of Youth,  
All pleasures unconceived await thee,  
As thou shalt *know* in very sooth,  
Although these joys will never *sate* thee. "  

And more, I now present to thee,  
Gold-headed Niav my own daughter,  
Who that her consort thou wouldst be,  
For thee afar sped over the water. "  

My thanks I tendered to the King,  
And to the Princess fair bowed loyal  
Soon did a pleasant journey bring  
Us to the glittering mansion royal.  

And nobles from the palace then,  
Both men and women came to meet us,  
And with a feast ambrosial, ten  
Grand days and nights they well did treat us.  

Espoused I Niav then in sooth,  
Sweet Patrick of the long oration;  
Thus went I to the Land of Youth,  
And sorrowful is my narration.  

P. Thy tale continue for us yet,  
Oisin of the golden arms slaying,  
From th' Land of Youth how thou didst get,  
I think it long till thou art saying.  

So with great pleasure tell us now,  
By Niav hadst thou any children;  
I'the Land of Youth how long wert thou,  
Relate us without grief bewildering.  

O. By Niav I had children three,  
Of fairest form and countenance cheering,  
Two blooming sons both bold and free,  
And daughter sweet and mild appearing.  

Long time I spent with pleasure fraught,  
Three hundred years and over, giving,  
To happiness, until I thought,  
I'd wish to see the Fenii living.  

P. Pleasant Oisin, yet continue,  
And tell thy children's situation,  
Their names give us, and tell us too,  
The land which is their present station.  

O. The Lands of " Virtue," " Life,  
" and " Youth,"  
And countless riches them awaited,  
Of kingly gold a crown and wreath,  
And jewels that misers might have sated.  

And Niav on my sons bestowed.  
My father's name and my son's daring,  
Most noble Finn the army's head,  
And Osgar of the red arms glaring.  

O. I myself, gave my daughter fair,  
The 'propriate name of "Flower of Women,"  
In virtue of her beauty rare,  
So sweet, so comely, and so blooming.  

The king's consent, I asked for then,  
And Niav's too — the golden headed,  
To visit Erin sweet again,  
His hosts and Finn to see, —once dreaded.  

" My leave thou'lt get," the princess said,  
" Though grievous that we should have parted,  
Lest home indeed when once thou’rt sped,  
Thou'lt not return, Oisin kindhearted. "  

My blooming wife, what dost thou dread,  
Whilst I the white steed am commanding ?  
Him back to thee, I'll safely lead,  
And here again thou’lt see me landing.  

L. "Oisin remember what I say—  
If to the ground one foot thou givest,  
Thou'lt not return hither aye—  
To this fine country which thou leavest.  

"I say again, and say in truth,  
If thou off th' white steed once alightest.  
Thou'lt never see the Land of Youth,  
Golden Oisin, of arms the brightest.  

" And this third time I caution thee,  
If thou off th' white steed take'st thy pressure,  
Blind, old, and feeble thou shalt be,  
*Sans* strength, activity or pleasure.  

O. "My woel my grief ! oh ! sweet Oisin,  
To Erin green that thou dost flee o'er,  
For 'tis not now as it has been,  
His hosts and Finn thou ne'er shalt see more.  

"In Erin now thou'lt all things miss,  
But hosts of saints — thou'lt see *them* ever,  
Loving Oisin — one parting kiss !  
To the Land of Youth thou'lt comeback never ! "  

I looked with pity in her face,  
And down my cheeks ran tears thick-streaming,  
Oh ! thou would'st mourn to see her case,  
Tearing the hair off her head gold-gleaming.  

To go and come, nor touch the lea,  
She under strict injunctions bound me—  
But if I broke them, she told me,  
My friends would ne'er again surround me.  

All which I promised her indeed,  
To carefully fulfill, nor doubt me,  
And then I crossed my fleet white steed,  
And bade farewell to all about me.  

I kissed my gentle consort fair,  
And grieved was I at th' separation  
My two sons and my daughter were  
Shedding salt tears, without cessation.  

Soon did the curling mane arise,  
As the proud courser bounded onward,  
Fleet as the eagle skims the skies,  
Smooth as a frigate sailing landward.  

O. Our story is not fully told,  
Of all to us that had a bearing,  
Till Erin green we did behold,  
The many-jewelled sweet green Erin.  

We never told you an untruth,  
O ! Patrick of the saints and orders,  
But how we left the Land of Youth,  
Related, as all true recorders.  

O ! Patrick if myself had been,  
As when I came, green Erin seeking,  
From death thy clerics nought could screen,  
I'd headless leave each body reeking.  

If bread enough thou gavest me,  
As Finn at all times would have given—  
Over it safe to strengthen thee,  
I'd pray unto thy King of Heaven.  

P. " Not cause of one complaint thou'lt get,  
But meat and drink unto thy filling,  
So continue thy story yet,  
For thy sweet voice, what music thrilling. "  

O. When I arrived in Erin green,  
Close search I made in all directions,  
But sought in vain — his hosts and Finn,  
For me left nothing but afflictions.  

Exploring thus — it chanced one day,  
That in the distance were appearing,  
A troop of men, and women gay,  
And soon my person they were nearing.  

O: They courteously saluted me,  
And at me gazed with admiration,  
As every one did closely scan  
My form with deepest penetration.  

Any account if they could give  
Of Finn, I asked them at last, or  
Did any of the Fenians live,  
Or what their final great disaster. "  

"We often have heard tell of Finn—  
That he surpassed in strength full many,  
In person, character and mien,  
Was never equalled yet by any. "  

"In many a book is written down,  
By sweetest bards, green Erin's sages,  
What we're unable to make known  
The deeds of Finn and former ages.  

" And we have heard he had a son,  
In strength surpassing now-a-day legions;  
Who to the Land of Youth had gone,  
With the Young Princess of those regions. "  

O. Nor Finn, nor one brave hero lived  
Oh ! when I heard that story fully,  
I was with greatest sorrow grieved,  
And full of stupid melancholy.  

Without delay I steered my way,  
Setting my face direct to Allvuin,  
In Leinster of the ample sway  
Where oft great deeds were acted well in.  

O. And great was my astonishment,  
Finn's court that I could not discover,  
’Twas gone and to discernment,  
Were — wastes with nettles flowing over.  

Alas, O Patrick, and alas !  
No hopeful word of Finn receiving,  
To me no pleasant journey 't was  
Through life it leaves me sorely grieving.  

P. Oisin desist from this thy grief,  
And shed thy tears to th' God of graces,  
The Fenii all are weak enough,  
And joy their sorrow ne'er replaces.  

O. A greater pity could not be,  
Than Finn in agony for ever,  
Who over him gained such victory,  
That slaying heroes was most clever ?  

P. Tis God that gained the victory,  
On whom tis useless to resent it,  
And all the Fenians and he,  
Condemned to hell, are there tormented.  

O. O ! Patrick do direct me where,  
The Fenii brave are so afflicted,  
And not a heaven or a hell is there,  
That long can keep them, weak subjected.  

If my brave son were on the sod,  
Who oft in battle dealt sore anguish  
There's not in hell nor i' th' heaven of God,  
A host though great he would not vanquish.  

P. Arguing not — let us agree,  
Valiant Oisin, and thy narration,  
Continue, what occurred to thee,  
I wish to hear on that occasion.  

O. Patrick the facts I will not screen  
Not long in lonely Allvuin staying  
The favourite resorts of Finn.  
Well did I search without delaying.  

And Glenasmole when passing o'er  
Numbers of men I saw together,  
Three hundred men were there or more,  
Appearing busy on the heather.  

And one of the assembly said,  
And in a lusty voice he said it  
" O princely hero lend us aid,  
And save us from great dangers dreaded. "  

In coming forward I did lag  
Not — and they had a flag of marble,  
And they did lift the weighty flag,  
But to uphold were unable.  

And they were grievously oppressed,  
And weak who were the great flag under,  
And by its weight were sore distressed,  
And senseless many it did render.  

Thus did a steward me accost,  
" O princely stout and youthful hero,  
Forthwith relieve my struggling host,  
Or shortly they're not worth a Zero. "  

O. How strange it is, and shameful that,  
( And the great number that if you are,  
The strength of you combined is not,  
Enough to lift this flag with power.  

Had Osgar lived ——Oisin's brave son,  
He'd take this flag and fling it duly,  
And with one hand — and when 'twas done,  
He'd think it nought,— I speak but truly.  

To my right side I forward leant,  
And took the flag and raised it o'er me,  
And seven perches then I sent,  
It reeling with great strength before me.  

Then did the golden girth give way,  
For by the flag's great force ' twas broken,  
Thus I became to age a prey,  
As doth my silvered head betoken.  

No sooner did I touch the ground,  
Than the white steed like light'ning started,  
And back his way he quickly found,  
And left me lonely broken-hearted.  

Alas ! my eye-sight quickly ran,  
From me — no comeliness commanding,  
I did become both old and wan,  
Sans strength esteem or understanding.
