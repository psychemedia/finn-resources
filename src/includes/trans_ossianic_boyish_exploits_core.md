THERE happened a meeting of valour and contention of battle, respecting the chieftainship of the Fians `[i.e. the leadership of the Irish militia.]` and the head-stewardship of Erin, between Cumhall, `[The best account of the military leader will be found in the battle of Cnucha, preserved in the book of Lismore]` son of Tréanmór, and Uirgrenn, son of Lughaidh Corr, [one] of the Luaighne `[a famous military lept in Menth descended from Luaighni. one of the brothers of Conn of the hundred battles, *Oggyia*, part iii. c, 57.]`,  i.e. this Cumhall was of the Corca-oiche of Cuil-contuinn `[a territory situated on the borders of the present counties of Meath and Cavan]`, for of these the Hui-Tarsigh his tribe were [a subsection]. Torba, daughter of Eochaman [one] of the Ernaans, had been the wife of Cumhall, untll he married Muireann Muncbaeinh, [Murinda of the fair neck]. The battle of Cnucha `[Connell Magheoghegan states in his translation of the annals of Clonmacnoiie, A.D. 726. that this is the place called Cattleknock, [near the river Liffey, county of Dublin.]]` was afterwards fougbt between them, i.e. between Cumhall and Uirgren.

Daire Dearg, son of Eochaidh Finn, son of Coirpre Galach, son of Mniredhach Muinderg, and his son Aedh, were fighting the battle along with Muirgrenn. Another name for this Daire was Morna Munchaim. The battle was then fought, Laichet and Aedh son of this Morna met together [in single combat] in the battle ; Luichet wounded Aedh, and destroyed one of his eyes, so that from this the name of Goll `[*Goll* is glossed *Caèch*, and means one-eyed, the same the the latin *luscus*.]` [Luscus] adhered to him from that time forth. Luichet fell by Goll. The keeper of his own corrhbolg `[I.e. a round bag, *sed* means a jewel or any article of value.]` of séds [treasure bag] wounded Cumhall, and Cumhall fell by Goll son of Morna in the battle, and carried off his arms and his head ; and from this there was a fundamental hatred between Finn and the sons of Morna, concerning which the historian sang: —

> " Goll was son of Daire Dearg of fame,  
> Son of Eochaidh Finn of valiant deeds,  
> Son of Cairbre Galach of prowess,  
> Son of Muireadhach of Finnmhagh. `[*Finnmhagh*, otherwise Maghfinn, a plain in the barony of Athlone, county of Roscommon, at this period possessed by the Firbolgs, of whom the Clanna-Morna were a sept.]`
> 
> This Goll slew Luichet of hundreds.  
> In the battle of Cnucha, no falsehood,—  
> Luichet Finn of noble chivalry,  
> By the son of Morna fell !  
> 
> It was by him fell Cumhall the Great,  
> In the battle of Cnucha of embattled hosts  
> What they fought this stout battle for,  
> Was for the Fian leadership in Erin.  
> 
> The Clanna Morna were in the battle,  
> And the Luaighni of Teamhair  
> For the Fiannship of the men of Fail was theirs  
> Under the hand of each valiant king.  
> 
> The victorious Cumhall had a son ;  
> The blood shedding Finn of hard weapons,  
> Finn and Goll of great fame.  
> Mightily they waged war.  
> 
> After this they made peace  
> Finn and Goll, of the hundred deeds,  
> Until the Banbh Sinna fell  
> On the plain at Teamhair Luachra, `[Teamhair Luachra, a place in Kerry not far from Castle Island, in the district of Sliabh Luacbra.]`  
> 
> Aedh was the name of Daire's son.  
> Until Luichet wounded him with dexterity.  
> But since the stout son of Luaighne wounded him  
> He was called by the name of Goll."

Cumhall left his wife pregnant, i. e. Muirenn, `[Muireann. This was very common as the proper proper name of a woman among the ancient Irish. It is explained in Cormac's Glossary, as meaning *mor-fhinn*, long-haired.]` and she brought forth a son, and gave him the name of Deimne. Fiacail the son of Guchenn, and Bodhmall the Druidess and Liath Luachra came to Muirenn and carried away the son, for his mother durst not keep him with her. Muirenn afterwards married Gleoir the Bedhanded, king of Lamhraighe, `[a people of Kerry in the west of Munster]` from which Finn is called the son of Gleoir. However Bodhmall and Liath taking the boy with them went to the forests of Sliabh Bladma, [*Sliabh Bladhma*, i.e. the mountain of Bladhma, (Ogygia III, 16.) now Slieve Bloom on the confines of the King's and Queen's Counties. It is sometimes called *Sliabh Smoil*. The summit of this mountain is called Mullach Eireann), the summit of Erin, and from it, the O'Dunnes have taken the motto of *Mallach Eireann aba*]` where the boy was nursed secretly. This was indeed necessary, for many a sturdy stalworth youth, and many a venomous inimical hero and angry morose champion of the warriors of Luaighni, and of the sons of Morna, were ready to despatch that boy, and [also] Tulcha the son of Cumhall. But however the two heroines nursed him for a long time in this manner.

His mother came at the end of six years after this to visit her son, for it was told to her, that he was at that place, and she feared the sons of Morna for him, i.e. [might kill him.] But however, she passed from one solitude to another, until she reached the forest of Sliabh Bladhma [Slieve Bloom,] and she found the hunting booth [hut] and the boy asleep therein, and she afterwards lifted him and pressed him to her bosom, and she then pregnant [from her second husband,] and then she composed these quatrains caressing her son :

" Sleep with gentle pleasant slumber, &c." `[The rest of this Lullaby is ls t. Indeed it vould appear from the shortness of the sentences, and the abrupt and flighty nature of the composition, that the whole story has been very much condensed, and in some places mutilated.]`

The woman afterwards bids farewell to the heroines, and asked them if they would take charge of him till he should be of heroic age ; and the son was afterwards reared by them till he was fit for hunting.

The boy came forth alone on a certain day, and saw the [the *pras lacha* with her brood of] ducks upon the lake. He made a shot at them, `[The original Irish is defective here. The words obviously omitted are supplied in brackets. In *Feis tighe Chonain* p. 129, it is stated that Finn in his first chase killed the *pras-lacha* (widgeon ?), and her clutch of twelve young birds.]` and cut off her feathers and wings, so that she died, and he afterwards took her to the hunting booth : and this was Finn's first chase.

He afterwards went away with certain poets to flee from the sons of Morna ; and they had him [concealed] about Crotta.`[i.e. Crotta Cliach, now the Galty mountains in the south of the county of Tipperary.]` These were their names, Futh and Ruth, and Regna of Mad Feada, and Teimle, and Oilpe, and Rogein. Here he was seized with the scurvy, so that he became a carrach [scald,] and was thence called Deimne Mael. There was a plunderer in Leinster at this time, by name Fiacuil, son of Codhna. Fiacuil came into Fidh Gaibhle `[now Feegile, in the parish of Cloonsast, north of Portarlington, in the King's County. This was the name of a famous wood in Leinster, in which St. Berchan, the Irish prophet, erected his church of Cloonsast, the ruins of which still remain.]` upon the poets, and killed them all except Deimne alone, who was afterwards with Fiacuil (in his house in a cold sheskin [marsh]. The two heroines came southwards to the house of Fiacuil, son of Codhna, in search of Deimne, and he was given to them ; and they took him from the south to the same place [where they had him previously].

He went forth one day alone [and never halted] till he reached Magh Life, `[i.e., the plain of the Liffey; a very level plain in the county of Kildare, through which the river Liffey winds its course.]` and on the green of a certain Dun [*fort*] there he saw youths hurling. He went to contend in agility or to hurl along with them. He came with them next day, and they sent the fourth of their number against him. He came again, and they sent the third of their number against him, and finally they went all against him, and he won one game from them all. What is thy name said they?

Deimne replied he. The youths tell this to the owner of the dun [*fort*] " Do ye kill him if he comes again, if ye are able," said he. We are not able to do aught unto him, replied they ; Deinme is his name. What is his appearance ? said he. He is a well-shaped fair [*finn*] youth, replied they, Deimne shall be named Finn therefore, said he. And hence these young men used to call him Finn,

He came the next day to them, and joined them in their game, they attacked him all together, with their hurlets, but he made at them and prostrated seven of them, and [then] made off from them into the forests of Sliabh Bladhma.

He afterwards returned at the end of a week to the same place. What the youths were at [then] was swimming in the lake which was close by [the dun.] The youths challenged him to swim with them. He plunged into the lake to them, and afterwards drowned nine of them in the lake, and then made to Bliabh Bladhma himself. Who drowned the youths ? enquired all. Finn, replied they [i.e. the survivors]. And from this the name of Finn clung to him [among all who heard of this deed of drowning.]

He came forth on one occasion out beyond Sliabh Bladhma, the two heroines being along with him, and they perceived a fleet herd of the wild deer of the forest of the mountain. Alas ; said the two old women, that we cannot detain one of these with us. I can, [said Finn] and he ran upon them, and catching two bucks of them, brings them with him to his hunting booth. After this he used to himt for them constantly. Depart from us now, young man, said the female warriors to him, for the sons of Morna are watching to kill thee.

He went away from them alone [and halted not,] till he reached Loch Lein `[*Loch Lein*, now the Lakes at Killamey in Kerry.]`, and over Luachair `[*Luachra*, i.e., Luachair Deaghaidh, a district in the now county of Kerry, containing the two Pap mountains.]`, till he hired in military service, with the king of Bentraighe. `[a district in South Munster, believed to have been coextensive with the barony of Bantry in the county of Cork.]` He did not go by any name here, but there was not at this time a hunter like him, and so the king said to him : if Cumhall had left any son, methinks thou art he, but we have not heard of Cumhall having left any son, but Tulcha Mac Cumhaill, but he is in military service with the king of Albain. `[Albain*, i.e., Scotland.]`

He afterwards bids farewell to the king, and goes away from him to Cairbrighe, at this day called Ciarraighe `[*Ciarraighe*, now Kerry. The territory so called extended in ancient times only from Tralee to the Shannon. Its more ancient names would appear to have been Cairbrighe, or Corbraighe.]` [Kerry], and he staid with this king in military service. The king came one day to play chess. He [Finn] played against him, and won seven games in succession. Who art thou ? said the king. The son of a peasant of the Luaighni of Teamhair, replied he ; Not so, said the king ; but thou art the son whom Muirenn [my present wife] brought forth for Cumhall ; and do not be here any longer, that thou mayest not be killed while under my protection.

After this he went to Guilleann g-Guanach `[*Cuilleann O' g-Cuanach*. This is the present name of Cullen, in the county of Tipperary, near the borders of the county of Limerick. It originally belonged to the territory of Coonagh, now a barony, in the north-east of the county of Limerick.]` to the house of Lochan, a chief smith : he had a very comely daughter, Cruithne by name ; she fell in love with the youth. I will give thee my daughter, said the smith, although I know not who thou art. The daughter then cohabited with the unknown youth. Make lances for me, said the youth, to the smith. Lochan then made two spears for him. He then bade farewell to Lochan, and went his way. My son, said Lochan, do not go on the passage on which the boar called Beo is usually [to be] seen ; it has devastated the [whole of] Middle Munster. But the youth happened to go on the very pass where the pig was. The pig afterwards rushed at him ! but he made a thrust of his spear at it, and drove it through it, so that he left it lifeless, and he brought the head of the pig with him to the smith as a dower for his daughter. From this is derived Sliabh muice `[*Sliabh Muice*, i.e., the Pig's mountain, now Slieve Muck, situated between the town of Tipperary and the glen of Aherlow.]` in Munster.

The youth then went into Connaught to look for [his uncle] Crimall, son of Trenmor. As he went on his way he heard the wail of one [solitary] woman. He went towards her, and viewed the woman : The first tear she shed was a tear of blood; and the other was a gush of blood, so that her mouth was red. " Thy mouth is red, woman !" said he- I have cause for it, said she : my only son was killed by a huge ugly hero, who came to me. What is thy son's name ? said he. Glonda is his name, said she. From him Ath-Glonda and Tochar-Olondain Maenmhagh `[*Maenmhagh*, Moinmoy, a territory lying round Lough Reagh in the present county of Galway ; but the situations of *Ath-Glonda*, i. e. the ford of Glonda, and of *Tochar Glonda*, the causeway of Glonda, are now unknown by these names.]` are called, and from this Belderg the name Ath-beldeirg `[*Ath'Beldeirg*, i.e., ford of Red mouth, not identified unless it be Ballyderg.]` remains ever since. Finn then went in pursuit of the hero, and they fought a combat, in which he fell by him [Finn.] The way he was situated was, he had the treasure bag with him, i.e., the [bag containing the] treasures of Cumhall. The person who fell here was Liath Luachra, he who first wounded Cumhall in the battle of Cnucha.

He now proceeds into Connaught, and finds Crimall, then an old man, in a desert there, and some of the old Fianns along with him, who were wont to chase for him. He gave him the Corrbholg, and told him the news from beginning to end :-— how he had killed the possessor of the treasures. He bids farewell to Crimall, and goes forward to *Finicés* [who lived at the Boinn `[i.e. the river Boyne in Meath.]` ] to learn poetry. He durst not remain in any part of Ireland until he took to learn poetry, from fear of the sons of Uirgrenn, and the sons of Morna. `[Here ends folio 119 of the original MS. and on the upper margin of folio 120, in the handwriting of the scribe, is the following observation :— *O Mary [Virgin] it is long till Edmund comes from the meeting.* This was Edmund Butler for whom the MS. was transcribed.]`

Seven years Finn-eges remained at the Boinn [Boyne] watching the salmon of linn-Feic, `[*Linn Feic* i. e. the pool of Fec, a deep pool in the Rirer Boyne, near *Ferta fer fecc*, the ancient name of the village of Slane, on this river.]` for it had been prophesied that he would eat the [sacred] salmon of Fec, and that he would be ignorant of nothing afterwards ! He caught the salmon, and ordered [his pupil] Deinme to roast it, and the poet told him not to eat of the salmon. The young man brought him the salmon after cooking it. Hast thou eaten any part of the salmon, young man ? said the poet, " No," replied the young man, but I burned my thumb, and put it into my mouth afterwards. What name is upon thee, youth ? said he. Deimne, replied the youth. " Finn is thy name, `[It appears that our hero had concealed from his master Finn-Egés that he had been known by the name of Finn, after he had drowned the nine boys in Magh-Liffe. But the poet finding that be had first tasted of the salmon of *Linn Feic* without intending it, saw that the ancient prophecy was fulfilled in him, and that his real name must be Finn. O'Flaherty states that our hero assisted his father-in-law Cormac son of Art, in compiling codes of laws ; and the Life of St Columkille compiled by Manus O'Donnell, states that he possessed the gift of prophecy, and foretold the birth and future greatness of St. Columbkille.]` O youth," said he, and it was to thee the salmon was [really] given, [in the prophecy] to be eaten [not to me], and thou art the Finn truly. The youth afterwards consumed the salmon, and it was from this the [preternatural] knowledge was given to Finn, i.e., when he used to put his thumb in his mouth, and not through Teinm Laegha [poetical incantation,] whatever he had been ignorant of used to be revealed to him.

He learned the three compositions which signify the poets, namely the *Teinm Laegha*, `[For a curious account of this poetical incantation as given in Cormac's glossary, the reader is referred to the " *Battle oMagh Rath*," printed for the Archaeological Society, p. 46. It is said that St. Patrick abolished the *Teinm Laegha* and the *Imbas for Osna*, as being profane rites, and allowed the poets to use another called *Dichedal do chendaibh* which was in itself not repugnant to Christianity, as requiring no offering to false gods or demons.]` the *Imus for Osna*, and the *Dicedul dicennaib* ; and it was then Finn composed this poem to prove his poetry :

May-day `[May-day, *cettemain*, is glossed *belltaine* by O'Clery. It signifies the beginning of summer.]` delightful time ! how beautiful the color `[color, [but also] face, countenance, mien.]`  
The blackbirds sing their full lay, would that Laighaig were here  
The cuckoos  sing in constant strains, how welcome is the noble  
Brilliance of the seasons ever; on the margin of the branchy woods  
The summer suaill `[gl. the swallows. The words of this fragment, which was considered to be the first composition of Finn, after having eaten the salmon of the Boyne, is very ancient and exceedingly obscure. The translation is only offered for the consideration of Irish scholars, for it is certain that the meaning of some of the lines are doubtful. The poem obyiously wants some lines at the end ; and Mr. Cleayer states, that the remaining portion of the manuscript is so defaced as to render it totally illegible.]` skim the stream, the swift horses seek the pool,  
The heath spreads out its long hair, the weak fair bogdown grows.  
Sudden consternation attacks the signs, the planets in their courses running exert an influence :
