THERE happened a meeting of valour and contention of battle, respecting the chieftainship of the Fians `[i.e. tbe leadership of the Irish militia.]` and the head-stewardship of Erin, between Cumhall, `[The best account of the military leader will be found in thie battle of Cnucha, preserved in the book of Lismore]` son of Tréanmór, and Uirgrenn, son of Lughaidh Corr, [one] of the Luaighne `[a famous military lept in Menth descended from Luaighni. one of the brothers of Conn of the hundred battles, *Oggyia*, part iii. c, 57.]`,  i.e. this Cumhaall was of the Corca-oiche of Cuil-contuinn `[a territory situated on the borders of the present counties of Meath and Cavan]`, for of these the Hui-Tarsigh his tribe were [a subsection]. Torba, daughter of Eochaman [one] of the Ernaans, had been the wife of Cumhall, untll he married Muireann Muncbaeinh, [Murinda of the fair neck]. The battle of Cnucha `[Connell Magheoghegan statsa in his translation of the annals of Clonmacnoiie, A.D. 726. that this is the place called Cattleknock, [near the river Liffey, county of Dublin.]]` was afterwards fougbt between them, i.e. between Cumhall and Uirgren.

Daire Dearg, son of Eochaidh Finn, son of Coirpre Galach, son of Mniredhach Muinderg, and his Bon Aedh, were fighting the battle along with Muirgrenn. Another name for this Daire was Morna Munchaim. The battle was then fought, Laichet and Aedh son of this Morna met together [in single combat] in the battle ; Luichet wounded Aedh, and destroyed one of his eyes, so that from this the name of Goll `[*Goll* is glossed *Caèch*, and means one-eyed, the same the the latin *luscus*.]` [Luscus] adhered to him from that time forth. Luichet fell by Goll. The keeper of his own corrhbolg `[I.e. a round bag, *sed* means a jewel or any article of value.]` of séds [treasure bag] wounded Cumhall, and Cumhall fell by Goll son of Morna in the battle, and carried off his arms and his head ; and from this there was a fundamental hatred between Finn and the sons of Morna, concerning which the historian sang: —

" Goll was son of Daire Dearg of fame,  
Son of Eochaidh Finn of valiant deeds,  
Son of Cairbre Galach of prowess,  
Son of Muireadhach of Finnmhagh. `[*Finnmhagh*, otherwise Maghfinn, a plain in the barony of Athlone, county of Roscommon, at this period possessed by the Firbolgs, of whom the Clanna-Morna were a sept.]`

This Goll slew Luichet of hundreds.  
In the battle of Cnucha, no falsehood,—  
Luichet Finn of noble chivalry,  
By the son of Morna fell !  

It was by him fell Cumhall the Great,  
In the battle of Cnucha of embattled hosts  
What they fought this stout battle for,  
Was for the Fian leadership in Erin.  

The Clanna Morna were in the battle,  
And the Luaighni of Teamhair  
For the Fiannship of the men of Fail was theirs  
Under the hand of each valiant king.  

The victorious Cumhall had a son ;  
The blood shedding Finn of hard weapons,  
Finn and Goll of great fame.  
Mightily they waged war.  

After this they made peace  
Finn and Goll, of the hundred deeds,  
Until the Banbh Sinna fell  
On the plain at Teamhair Luachra, `[Teamhair Luachra, a place in Kerry not far from Castle Island, in the district of Sliabh Luacbra.]`  

Aedh was the name of Daire's son.  
Until Luichet wounded him with dexterity.  
But since the stout son of Luaighne wounded him  
He was called by the name of Goll."

Cumhall left his wife pregnant, i. e. Muirenn, `[Muireann. This was very common as the proper proper name of a woman among the ancient Irish. It is explained in Cormac's Glossary, as meaning *mor-fhinn*, long-haired.]` and she brought forth a son, and gave him the name of Deimne. Fiacail the son of Guchenn, and Bodhmall the Druidess and Liath Luachra came to Muirenn and carried away the son, for his mother durst not keep him with her. Muirenn afterwards married Gleoir the Bedhanded, king of Lamhraighe, `[a people of Kerry in the west of Munster]` from which Finn is called the son of Gleoir. However Bodhmall and Liath taking the boy with them went to the forests of Sliabh Bladma, [*Sliabh Bladhma*, i.e. the mountain of Bladhma, (Ogygia III, 16.) now Slieve Bloom on the confines of the King's and Queen's Counties. It is sometimes called *Sliabh Smoil*. The summit of this mountain is called Mullach Eireann), the summit of Erin, and from it, the O'Dunnes have taken the motto of *Mallach Eireann aba*]` where the boy was nursed secretly. This was indeed necessary, for many a sturdy stalworth youth, and many a venomous inimical hero and angry morose champion of the warriors of Luaighni, and of the sons of Morna, were ready to despatch that boy, and [also] Tulcha the son of Cumhall. But however the two heroines nursed him for a long time in this manner.

His mother came at the end of six years after this to visit her son, for it was told to her, that he was at that place, and she feared the sons of Morna for him, i.e. [might kill him.] But however, she passed from one solitude to another, until she reached the forest of Sliabh Bladhma [Slieve Bloom,] and she found the hunting booth [hut] and the boy asleep therein, and she afterwards lifted him and pressed him to her bosom, and she then pregnant [from her second husband,] and then she composed these quatrains caressing her son :

" Sleep with gentle pleasant slumber, &c." `[The rest of this Lullaby is ls t. Indeed it vould appear from the shortness of the sentences, and the abrupt and flighty nature of the composition, that the whole story has been very much condensed, and in some places mutilated.]`

The woman afterwards bids farewell to the heroines, and asked them if they would take charge of him till he should be of heroic age ; and the son was afterwards reared by them till he was fit for hunting.

The boy came forth alone on a certain day, and saw the [the *pras lacha* with her brood of] ducks upon the lake. He made a shot at them, `[The original Irish is defective here. The words obviously omitted are supplied in brackets. In *Feis tighe Chonain* p. 129, it is stated that Finn in his first chase killed the *pras-lacha* (widgeon ?), and her clutch of twelve young birds.]` and cut off her feathers and wings, so that she died, and he afterwards took her to the hunting booth : and this was Finn's first chase.

He afterwards went away with certain poets to flee from the sons of Morna ; and they had him [concealed] about Crotta.`[i.e. Crotta Cliach, now the Galty mountains in the south of the county of Tipperary.]` These were their names, Futh and Ruth, and Regna of Mad Feada, and Teimle, and Oilpe, and Rogein. Here he was seized with the scurvy, so that he became a carrach [scald,] and was thence called Deimne Mael. There was a plunderer in Leinster at this time, by name Fiacuil, son of Codhna. Fiacuil came into Fidh Gaibhle `[now Feegile, in the parish of Cloonsast, north of Portarlington, in the King's County. This was the name of a famous wood in Leinster, in which St. Berchan, the Irish prophet, erected his church of Cloonsast, the ruins of which still remain.]` upon the poets, and killed them all except Deimne alone, who was afterwards with Fiacuil (in his house in a cold sheskin [marsh]. The two heroines came southwards to the house of Fiacuil, son of Codhna, in search of Deimne, and he was given to them ; and they took him from the south to the same place [where they had him previously].

He went forth one day alone [and never halted] till he reached Magh Life, `[i.e., the plain of the Liffey; a very level plain in the county of Kildare, through which the river Liffey winds its course.]` and on the green of a certain Dun [*fort*] there he saw youths hurling. He went to contend in agility or to hurl along with them. He came with them next day, and they sent the fourth of their number against him. He came again, and they sent the third of their number against him, and finally they went all against him, and he won one game from them all. What is thy name said they?

Deimne replied he. The youths tell this to the owner of the dun [*fort*] " Do ye kill him if he comes again, if ye are able," said he. We are not able to do aught unto him, replied they ; Deinme is his name. What is his appearance ? said he. He is a well-shaped fair [*finn*] youth, replied they, Deimne shall be named Finn therefore, said he. And hence these young men used to call him Finn,

He came the next day to them, and joined them in their game, they attacked him all together, with their hurlets, but he made at them and prostrated seven of them, and [then] made off from them into the forests of Sliabh Bladhma.

He afterwards returned at the end of a week to the same place. What the youths were at [then] was swimming in the lake which was close by [the dun.] The youths challenged him to swim with them. He plunged into the lake to them, and afterwards drowned nine of them in the lake, and then made to Bliabh Bladhma himself. Who drowned the youths ? enquired all. Finn, replied they [i.e. the survivors]. And from this the name of Finn clung to him [among all who heard of this deed of drowning.]

He came forth on one occasion out beyond Sliabh Bladhma, the two heroines being along with him, and they perceived a fleet herd of the wild deer of the forest of the mountain. Alas ; said the two old women, that we cannot detain one of these with us. I can, [said Finn] and he ran upon them, and catching two bucks of them, brings them with him to his hunting booth. After this he used to himt for them constantly. Depart from us now, young man, said the female warriors to him, for the sons of Morna are watching to kill thee.

He went away from them alone [and halted not,] till he reached Loch Lein `[*Loch Lein*, now the Lakes at Killamey in Kerry.]`, and over Luachair `[*Luachra*, i.e., Luachair Deaghaidh, a district in the now county of Kerry, containing the two Pap mountains.]`, till he hired in military service, with the king of Bentraighe. `[a district in South Munster, believed to have been coextensive with the barony of Bantry in the county of Cork.]` He did not go by any name here, but there was not at this time a hunter like him, and so the king said to him : if Cumhall had left any son, methinks thou art he, but we have not heard of Cumhall having left any son, but Tulcha Mac Cumhaill, but he is in military service with the king of Albain. `[Albain*, i.e., Scotland.]`

He afterwards bids farewell to the king, and goes away from him to Cairbrighe, at this day called Ciarraighe `[*Ciarraighe*, now Kerry. The territory so called extended in ancient times only from Tralee to the Shannon. Its more ancient names would appear to have been Cairbrighe, or Corbraighe.]` [Kerry], and he staid with this king in military service. The king came one day to play chess. He [Finn] played against him, and won seven games in succession. Who art thou 7 said the king. The son of a peasant of the Luaighni of Teamhair, replied he ; Not so, said the king ; but thou art the son whom Muirenn [my present wife] brought forth for Cumhall ; and do not be here any longer, that thou mayest not be killed while under my protection.

After this he went to Guilleann g-Guanach `[*Cuilleann O' g-Cuanach*. This is the present name of Cullen, in the county of Tipperary, near the borders of the county of Limerick. It originally belonged to the territory of Coonagh, now a barony, in the north-east of the county of Limerick.]` to the house of Lochan, a chief smith : he had a very comely daughter, Cruithne by name ; she fell in love with the youth. I will give thee my daughter, said the smith, although I know not who thou art. The daughter then cohabited with the unknown youth. Make lances for me, said the youth, to the smith. Lochan then made two spears for him. He then bade farewell to Lochan, and went his way. My son, said Lochan, do not go on the passage on which the boar called Beo is usually [to be] seen ; it has devastated the [whole of] Middle Munster. But the youth happened to go on the very pass where the pig was. The pig afterwards rushed at him ! but he made a thrust of his spear at it, and drove it through it, so that he left it lifeless, and he brought the head of the pig with him to the smith as a dower for his daughter. From this is derived Sliabh muice `[*Sliabh Muice*, i.e., the Pig's mountain, now Slieve Muck, situated between the town of Tipperary and the glen of Aherlow.]` in Munster.

The youth then went into Connaught to look for [his uncle] Crimall, son of Trenmor. As he went on his way he heard the wail of one [solitary] woman. He went towards her, and viewed the woman : The first tear she shed was a tear of blood; and the other was a gush of blood, so that her mouth was red. " Thy mouth is red, woman !" said he- I have cause for it, said she : my only son was killed by a huge ugly hero, who came to me. What is thy son's name ? said he. Glonda is his name, said she. From him Ath-Glonda and Tochar-Olondain Maenmhagh `[*Maenmhagh*, Moinmoy, a territory lying round Lough Reagh in the present county of Galway ; but the aitiiations of *Ath-Glonda*, i. e. the ford of Glonda, and of *Tochar Glonda*, the causeway of Glonda, are now unknown by these names.]` are called, and from this Belderg the name Ath-beldeirg `[*Ath'Beldeirg*, i.e., ford of Red mouth, not identified unless it be Ballyderg.]` remains ever since. Finn then went in pursuit of the hero, and they fought a combat, in which he fell by him [Finn.] The way he was situated was, he had the treasure bag with him, i.e., the [bag containing the] treasures of Cumhall. The person who fell here was Liath Luachra, he who first wounded Cumhall in the battle of Cnucha.

He now proceeds into Connaught, and finds Crimall, then an old man, in a desert there, and some of the old Fianns along with him, who were wont to chase for him. He gave him the Corrbholg, and told him the news from beginning to end :-— how he had killed the possessor of the treasures. He bids farewell to Crimall, and goes forward to *Finicés* [who lived at the Boinn `[i.e. the river Boyne in Meath.]` ] to learn poetry. He durst not remain in any part of Ireland until he took to learn poetry, from fear of the sons of Uirgrenn, and the sons of Morna. `[Here ends folio 119 of the original MS. and on the upper margin of folio 120, in the handwriting of the scribe, is the following observation :— *O Mary [VirginJ it is long till Edmund comes from the meeting.* This was Edmund Butler for whom the MS. was transcribed.]`

Seven years Finn-eges remained at the Boinn [Boyne] watching the salmon of linn-Feic, `[*Linn Feic* i. e. the pool of Fee, a deep pool in the Rirer Boyne, near *Ferta fer fecc*, the ancient name of the village of Slane, on this river.]` for it had been prophesied that he would eat the [sacred] salmon of Fee, and that he would be ignorant of nothing afterwards ! He caught the salmon, and ordered [his pupil] Deinme to roast it, and the poet told him not to eat of the salmon. The young man brought him the salmon after cooking it. Hast thou eaten any part of the salmon, young man ? said the poet, " No," replied the young man, but I burned my thumb, and put it into my mouth afterwards. What name is upon thee, youth ? said he. Deimne, replied the youth. " Finn is thy name, `[It appears that our hero had concealed from his master Finn-Egés that he had been known by the name of Finn, after he had drowned the nine boys in Magh-Liffe. But the poet finding that be had first tasted of the salmon of *Linn Feic* without intending it, saw that the ancient prophecy was fulfilled in him, and that his real name must be Finn. O'Flaherty states that our hero assisted his father-in-law Cormac son of Art, in compiling codes of laws ; and the Life of St Columkille compiled by Manus O'Donnell, states that he possessed the gift of prophecy, and foretold the birth and future greatness of St. Columbkille.]` O youth," said he, and it was to thee the salmon was [really] given, [in the prophecy] to be eaten [not to me], and thou art the Finn truly. The youth afterwards consumed the salmon, and it was from this the [preternatural] knowledge was given to Finn, i.e., when he used to put his thumb in his mouth, and not through Teinm Laegha [poetical incantation,] whatever he had been ignorant of used to be revealed to him.

He learned the three compositions which signify the poets, namely the *Teinm Laegha*, `[For a curious account of this poetical incantation as given in Cormac's glossary, the reader is referred to the " *Battle oMagh Rath*," printed for the Archaeological Society, p. 46. It is said that St. Patrick abolished the *Teinm Laegha* and the *Imbas for Osna*, as being profane rites, and allowed the poets to use another called *Dichedal do chendaibh* which was in itself not repugnant to Christianity, as requiring no offering to false gods or demons.]` the *Imus for Osna*, and the *Dicedul dicennaib* ; and it was then Finn composed this poem to prove his poetry :

The words of this fragment, which was considered to be the first composition of Finn, after having eaten the salmon of the Boyne, is very ancient and exceedingly obscure. The translation is only offered for the consideration of Irish scholars, for it is certain that the meaning of some of the lines are doubtful.

The Battle of Cnucha ; a médiéval Irish text, with a translation, by W. M. Hennessy
W. M. Hennessy, 1875

pp.86-91

THE BATTLE OF CNUCHA.

[The principal value of the following story from *Lebor na huidre*, an Irish Ms. written circa A. D, 1100, is that it presents probably the oldest written form of one important fragment of the legendary history so widely extended among the Celtic family in the British Islands, in which Find mac Cumhaill (or Fingal) occupies the part of principal hero, and Oisin, or Ossian, the part of narrator. The style of the narrative, so terse and simple, is in favourable contrast with the prosy, redundant, oftentimes absurdly bombastic compositions of a later period, and justifies the opinion of scholars that it was written some centuries earlier than the date of the Ms. from which the présent text has been copied. The language, also, is singularly pure; on which account care has been taken to print in different type the portions of words represented by abbreviations in the original.

The admirers of Mac Pherson's ambitious attempt to localize the Ossianic legend within the narrow limits of North Britain, now happily through the growth of a more independent and unselfish spirit of criticism fast becoming fewer in number, will see with surprise that all the characters in this most ancient fragment of the literature of which he would rob all other branches of the Celtic race, are purely Irish. The places mentioned are likewise Irish. But though the Irish may justly claim to have nursed Find, or at least to have stood to him in the traditional relationship of God-parents, they cheerfully allow all their tribal connections (and foremost among them the Scotch people) to share the glory of his manhood.

There are other versions of the birth and origin of Find Mac Cumhaill, some of which are noticed in Campbell's *Leabhar na Feinne*, vol. I. pp. 33, 34, etc.; but all are of much later date. The most important of these is the tract pubiished by the late Dr O'Donovan, from a fifteenth century Ms., in the *Transactions of the Ossianic Society*, vol. IV. (Dublin, 1859), on the " Boyish Exploits of F. m. C. " Dr O'Donovan, like most other Irish antiquaries, regarded Find Mac Cumhaill as a genuine historical personage, who resided mostly at *Almhu* in the County of Kildare, but possessed another residence at a place called Magh-Elle (now Moyelly) in the adjoining King's County. That a person named Find Mac Cumhaill did live at the time indicated (3rd cent.) I do not deny. But it is as certain that his history has degenerated into a pure myth, as that there is now no trace of a dun or fortress on the hill of *Almu*, or Allen.

In autumn last I had the pleasure of visiting the hill of Allen with Mr. J. F. Campbell, the indefatigable and enlightened coUector of Ossianic legends, and although we were shewn the thicket out of which Find's hounds, Bran and Sceolán, are still fabled to start nightly, to the alarm of late wayfarers, we could find no trace of such a *dun* as is referred to in the following tract. The hill is almost a bare rock, on which materials to erect a *dun* or even a *rath* are now scarcely obtainable. But beautifuUy situated in the midst of a lovely country, over which it commands a wide prospect, it was well adapted for a place of assembly, or for the chase.

The allusion to Tadg's command that Find's mother should be burned is curious. The existence of the practice of burning women for incontinency among the Celts of Britain and Ireland is borne out by other references in ancient tracts. But the discussion of the question hère would extend this note beyond reasonable limits. — W. M. Hennessy.]


THE CAUSE OF THE BATTLE OF CNUCHA `[*Cnucha.* The place now called Castleknock (in Irish *Caislen-Cnucha*), on the river Liffey, near Dublin, where there is a remarkable tumulus. Some good copies of the old Irish taie called " the battle of Cnucha ", a tale well worthy of publication, are in the collection of the Royal Irish Academy.]` HERE :

When Cathair Mór `[*Cathair Mor*. Cathair the Great. As the name Cathair is now generally anglicised " Charles, " Cathair Mor might be rendered as "Charlemagne. " The Four Masters give his obit under A. D. 122, which would be much too early for the chronology of the Fingalian era. O'Flaherty, who refers the death of Cathair Mor to A. D. 177 (*Ogygia*, pp. 310-12) is nearer to the mark.]`, son of Fedelmith Fir-urglais, son of Cormac Gelta-gaith, was in the kingship of Temhair `[*Temhair*. Now Tara, co Meath.]` and Conn Ced-chathach `[*Conn Ced-chathach*. Hundred-battled Conn. Obiit A. D. 197 (O'Flaherty).]` in Cenandos, in (the) rigdomna's land, Cathair had a celebrated druid, to wit, Nuadu son of Achi, son of Dathi, son of Brocan, son of Fintan, of Tuath-Dathi in Bregas `[*Brega*. A district anciently comprising the greater part of the present county of Meath, aud portions of Westmeath and Dublin counties.]`. The druid was soliciting land in Laigen `[*Laigen*. Lagenia, or Leinster, which province did not anciently include any of the counties north of Dublin county. The expression illaignib means " in Lageniensibus "; for Irish writers in speaking of the provinces, regarded the people, not the districts inhabited by them.]` from Cathair; for he knew that it was in Laigen his successorship would be.

Cathair gave him his choice of land. The land the druid chose was Almu `[*Almu. Now the hill of Allen, near Newbridge in the county of Kildare.]`.

She that was wife to Nuadhu was Almu, daughter of Becan.

A dûn was built by the druid then in Almu, and *alamu* `[*Alamu*. Some kind of colouring stuff.]` was rubbed to its wall, until it was ail white; and perhaps it was from that ,the name) ' Almu ' was applied to it; of which was said :

> All-white is the *dún* of battle renown  
> As if it had received the lime of Ireland;  
> From the aîamu which he gave to his house  
> Hence it is that ' Almu ' is applied to Almu.

Nuadu's wife, Almu, was entreating that her name might be given to the hill; and that request was granted to her, to wit, that her name should be upon the hill; for it was in it she was buried afterwards; of which was said :

> Almu — beautiful was the woman ! —  
> Wife of Nuadhu the great, son of Achi.  
> She entreated — the division was just —  
> That her name (should be) on the perfect hill.

Nuadu had a distinguished son, to wit, Tadhg son of Nuadhu. Rairiu, daughter of Dond-duma, was his wife. A celebrated druid, also, (was) Tadg.

Death came to Nuadu `[*Death came to Nuadu*. An unusual way, in Irish, of saying that Nuadu died. The ordinary form would be *fuair Nuadu bas*  lit. " N. found death. "]`; and he left his *dún*, as it was, to his son ; and it is Tadg that was druid to Cathair in the place of his father.

Rairiu bore a daughter to Tadhg, i e. Murni Muncaim `[*Murni Muncaim* lit. Murni "of the fair neck ". The dimin. of *Murni* (*murnin*, pron. *moorneen*) is a term of endearment still applied to girls by the Irish-speaking people.]` her name.

This maiden grew up in great beauty, so that the sons of the kings and mighty lords of Ireland were wont to be courting her.

Cumall, son of Trenmor, king-warrior of Ireland, was then in the service of Cond `[*In the service of Cond*. The original is *fri laim cuind*; lit. " ad manus Quinti. "]`. He also, like ever every other person, was demanding the maiden. Nuadu gave him a refusal, for he knew that it was on account of him Cumall he would have to leave Almu `[*To leave Almu*. The original of the clause " he would have to leave Almu " (*no biad scarad do fri Almain*), literally translated, would read " there would be separation for him with Almu. "]`.

The same woman `[*Woman*. She is described, in the Irish genealogical tracts, as "Baine, daughter of Scal Balb, king of the Fomori, i. e. of Finland ". See the Account of the celebrated women of Ireland, in the Book of Lecan, fol. 184 sq.]` was mother to Cumhall and to Cond's father, to wit, Fedelmid Rechtaide.

Cumall cornes, however, and takes Murni by force, in elopement with him, since she had not been given to him. Tadg comes to Cond, and relates to him his profanation by Cumall, and he began to incite Cond, and to reproach him.

Cond dispatches messengers to Cumall, and ordered him to leave Ireland, or to restore his daughter to Tadhg. Cumall said he would not give her; but everything he would give, and not the woman. Cond sent his soldiers, and Urgrend son of Lugaid Corr king of Luagni `[*Luagni*, or *Luagni Temrach*. A sept seated near Tara, in the present county Meath.]`, and Daire Derc son of Eochaid, and his son Aed (who was afterwards called Goll `[*Goll*, i. e. blind. Vid. O'Donovan's suppl. to *O'Reilly*, in voce.]`) to attack Cumall. Cumall assembles his army against them; and the battle of Cnucha is fought between them, and Cumall is slain there, and a slaughter of his people is effected.

Cumall fell by Goll son of Morna. Luchet wounded Goll in his eye, so that he destroyed his eye. And hence it is that (the name) "Goll " attached to him ; whereof was said :

> Aed was the name of Daire's son,  
> Until Luchet of fame wounded him;  
> Since the heavy lance wounded him,  
> Therefore, he has been called Goll.

Goll killed Luchet. It is for that reason, moreover, that a hereditary feud existed between the sons of Morna and Find.

Dairi had two names, to wit, Morna and Dairi.

Murni went, after that, to Cond; for her father rejected her, and did not let her (come) to him, because she was pregnant; and he said to his people to burn her `[*To burn her*. Many instances occur in Irish taies of the existence of the practice of burning women for adultery. In the story of Corc Mac Lugdach (Book of Leinster, fol. 206, a, 2), we read, *Ba bés itossaig nach ingen dognid bais dar cenn a urnaidm do breothad. " It was the custom at first to burn any woman who committed lust in violation of her compact.]`. And nevertheless, he dared not (compass) her destruction against Cond.

The girl was asking of Cond how she should act. Cond said: " Go, " said he, " to Fiacal son of Concend, to Temhair-Mairci, and let thy delivery be effected there " : (for a sister to Cumall was Fiacal's wife, Bodball Bendron).

Condla, Cond's servant, went with her, to escort her, until she came to Fiacal's house, to Temhair-Mairci. Welcome was given to the girl then; and her arrivai there was good. The girl was delivered afterwards, and bare a son; and Demni was given as a name to him.

The boy is nursed by them, after that, until he was capable of committing plunder on every one who was an enemy to him. He then proclaims battle or single combat against Tadg, or else the full *eric* of his father to be given to him. Tadg said that he would give him judgement therein. The judgement was given; and this is the judgement that was given to him, to wit, that Almu, as it was, should be ceded to him for ever, and Tadg to leave it. It was done so. Tadg abandoned Almu to Find, and came to Tuath-Dathi, to his own hereditary land; and he abode in Cnoc-Réin, which is called Tulach-Taidg `[*Tulach-Taidg*. " Tadg's hill." The situation of this place, which must be in Meath, has not yet been satisfactorily determined.]` today; for it is from him it has been called Tulach-Taidg frora that time to this, So that hence was said this :

> Find demands from Tadg of ihe towers,  
> For killing Cumall the great,  
> Battle, without respite, without delay,  
> Or that he should obtain single combat.  
> Because Tadg was not able to sustain battle  
> Against the high prince,  
> He abandoned to him, it was for him enough,  
> Almu altogether, as it stood.

Find went afterwards to Almu, and abode in it. And it is it that was his principal residence whilst he lived.

Find and Goll concluded peace after that ; and the eric of his father was given by the Clann-Morna to Find. And they lived peacefully, until (a quarrel) occurred between the min Temhair-Luachra `[*Temhair-Luachra*. " Temhair of Luachair ". Luachair, or Luachair-Dedad, was the ancient name of the hilly district stretching between the counties of Limerick and Kerry. the latter of which is still called Ciarraighe-Luachra by the Irish-speaking people of Munster. The word " Temhair," the etymology of which is yet uncertain, enters into the composition of many topographical names in Ireland.]`, regarding the Slanga-pig `[*Slanga-pig*. The Slanga-pigs, like the *mucca Drebrend*, or " pigs of Drebriu, " and the *mucca Manannain*, or " pigs of Manannan " (the Irish Neptune), were magical swine, which reappeared as often as they were killed and eaten. Irish romance is full of them; and in an account preserved in the Book of Fermoy, fol. 215, b. 2, it is stated that the last Slanga-pig distributed to the men of Ireland, satisfied 25 battalions!]`, when Banb-Sinna son of Maelenaig was slain; of which was said :

> Afterwards they made peace —  
> Find and Goll of mighty deeds —  
> Until Banb-Sinna was slain
> Regarding the pig, in Temhair-Luachra.
