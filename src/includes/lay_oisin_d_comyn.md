LAY OF OISIN ON THE LAND OF THE YOUNG, AS HE NARRATED IT TO HOLY PATRICK.  

1\. P.— O noble Oisin ! O son of the king !  
The best in exploit, prowess, and strife,  
Narrate to us now without grief  
How thou didst survive after the Fiann.  

2\. O.— I shall tell that [to] thee, O new (-come) Patrick !  
Though sad (it seems) to me, its mentioning aloud.  
After the severe battle of Gabhra,  
In which was slain, alas ! the valiant Oscar.  

3\. A day of (those on) which we were all (met), the Fiann,  
Generous Fionn and those who lived of us (were) there.  
Though it was sad and melancholy our story,  
After our heroes being weak (*slaiin*).  

4\. In chase by us (*we being in chase*) (on) a misty morning.  
At the border-shores of Loch Lein,  
Where (there) were fragrant trees most sweet (of) blossom,  
And music every time melodiously at birds, (*birds were always singing melodiously.*)  

5\. The hornless deer was awakened by us,  
(Which) was the best (in) spring, course and nimbleness ;  
Our hounds and our hunting-dogs were all (together)  
Close in her wake in full chase.  

6\. 'Twas not long till we saw from the west  
The hasty (hard) rider coming towards us—  
A gentle maiden most fair of countenance,  
On a white slender steed most sprightly in nimbleness.  

7\. We all desisted from the chase  
On beholding (the) form of the queenly woman,  
Wonder seized Fionn and the Fiann—  
(Seeing) that they never beheld a woman so fair.  

8\. There was a royal crown on her head,  
And a brown mantle of [the] precious silk  
Studded with stars of red gold,  
Covering her shoes down to the grass.  

9\. (There) was a ring of gold hanging down  
From each yellow curl of her hair like gold ;  
Her blue eyes (were) clear without a cloud,  
Like a drop of dew on (the) top of the grass.  

10\. Her cheek was redder than the rose,  
And her complexion was fairer than (the) swan on (the) wave.  
More sweet yet was (the) taste of her balsam (lips)  
Than honey which would be mixed through red wine.  

11\. There was a wide, long, smooth garment  
Covering the white [steed] horse ;  
A carved saddle of red gold,  
And (she had) a bridle (with a) mouth (-bit) of gold in her right hand.  

12\. (There) were four shapely shoes under him  
Of [the] yellow gold of most clear brightness,  
A wreath of silver at (the) back of his head,  
And there was not in the world a steed (which) was better.  

13\. She came to the presence of Fionn,  
And spoke gently (and) modestly in sound,  
And she said, " O king of the Fiann,  
It is long (and) distant now my journey."  

14\. F.— " Who (art thou) thyself O young queen?  
Most excellent (in) form, beauty, and countenance,  
Narrate to us (the) cause of thy story,  
Thine own name and thy country."  

15\. N.— " Niamh of (the) head of gold (*golden hair*) [it] is my name,  
O clever Fionn of the great hosts,  
Above (the) women of the world I received a calling, (esteem)  
I am (the) fair daughter of (the) king of the young."  

16\. F.— Narrate to us, O clement queen.  
What (was the) cause (of) thy coming across the sea afar.  
Whether (is) it thy companion (who) went from thee,  
Or what (is) the trouble that is upon thyself?'  

17\. N.— " It is not my companion who went from me  
And as yet I was not spoken of (*bethrothed*) with any man,  
O king of the Fiann of highest repute—  
But affection and love I gave to thy son !"  

18\. F.— " Which [of them] of my children, O blooming virgin,  
(Is he) in whom thou gavest love, or yet fondness,—  
Conceal not on (*from*) us now (thej cause  
And narrate to us thy case, O woman!"  

19\. N.— " I myself shall tell that to thee, O Fionn,  
To thy beautiful son, of firm arms,  
Magnanimous Oisin of the strong hands,  
(He is) the hero, I am now speaking (of).''  

20\. F.— What (is) the cause that thou gavest love,  
O fair virgin of the free-flowing hair,  
To my own son beyond all—  
And the number of high princes (who are) under the sun."  

21\. N.— Not without reason, O king of the Fiann,  
I came (from) afar for his sake, (*for him*)  
But an account to get (*because of an account which I had got*) of his prowess.  
The goodness of his person, and of his mind.  

22\. " 'Tis many a king's son and high prince.  
Gave me affection and lasting love,  
I never consented to any man,  
Until I gave love to the valiant Oisin ! "  

23\. O.— By that hand upon thee, O Patrick 1  
Though ('twas) not shameful to me (it seemed) as a story  
There was not a limb of me which was not in love,  
With the lovely virgin of the free-flowing hair.  

24\. I took [on] her hand in my grasp,  
Apd said in sweet-voiced speech,—  
"A true gentle welcome before thee  
O young queen to the (this) country.  

25\. " 'Tis thou (who) art the brightest and fairest (in) form,  
Tis thou (whom) I would prefer as a wife,  
'Tis thou (art) my choice beyond (the) women of the world,  
O gentle star, most fair (of) countenance."  

26\. N.— Obligations which true heroes do not suffer (tor efuse)  
O generous Oisin, I put before thee,—  
(To) come with myself now on my steed,  
Till we reach back to (the) Land of the young.  

27\. It is the most pleasant country to be found,  
Greatest (in) repute now under the sun,  
(There are) trees bending with fruit and blossom,  
And foliage growing on (the) tops (of the) branches.  

28\. "Plentiful in it are honey and wine,  
And all things [of what] eye hath seen,  
Decline shall not come on thee with (*during*) thy existence  
Death or decay thou shalt not see.  

29\. " Thou wilt get feasts, play and drinking,  
Thou wilt get sweet music on strings,—  
Thou wilt get silver and gold,  
Thou wilt get also many jewels.  

30\. Thou wilt get a hundred swords without deceit,  
Thou wilt get a hundred satin garments of costly silk,  
Thou wilt get a hundred steeds most active in tumult,  
And thou wilt get a hundred with them of keen hounds.  

31\. " Thou wilt get the royal coronet of (the) "king of the young."  
Which (he) never yet gave to any one under the sun,  
Which will make a protection for thee by night and day,  
In battle, in strife, and in rough conflict.  

32\. " Thou wilt get a fitting armour of defence.  
And a gold-headed sword most active for stroke,  
From which never escaped any one alive,  
Who beheld yet the sharp weapon.  

33\. " Thou wilt get a hundred suits of mail, and shirts of satin.  
Thou wilt get a hundred cows; and yet a hundred calves,  
Thou wilt get a hundred sheep with their fleeces of gold,  
Thou wilt get a hundred jewels which are not in the world.  

34\. " Thou wilt get a hundred maidens merry (and) young.  
Radiant, shining like the sun,  
Most excellent in shape, form and visage,  
And sweeter of mouth than (the) music of the birds.  

35\. " Thou wilt get a hundred heroes most brave in strife.  
Also most active in exercises of agility ;  
Armed, accoutred, in thy presence,  
In (the) Land of the young, if thou comest with me.  

35a\. " Thou will get everything of what I have said to thee,  
And happiness moreover which is not clear to me to mention  
Thou wilt get beauty, strength and vigour,  
And I myself will be with thee as wife."  

36\. O.— Any refusal I shall not give from me.  
O charming queen of the ringlets of gold,—  
Thou art my choice beyond the women of the world,  
And I will go with pleasure to (the) Land of the young."  

37\. On (the) back of the steed we went both,  
In front of me the virgin sat,—  
She said, O Oisin, let us stay easily (*go slowly*)  
Till we reach (the) mouth of the great sea."  

38\. Then the steed arose in strength, (*went with speed*)  
The time we (had) reached to (the) border of the strand,  
He shook himself then for travelling,  
And let t hree neighs out of him aloud.  

39\. When Fionn and the Fiann saw  
The steed hastily in the journey ,  
Turning his) face on the mighty sea  
They let three shouts of weeping and grief.  

40\. F.— " O Oisin," says Fionn slowly, weakly,  
" It is) my [own] grief thou (to be) going from me,  
And without expectation with me again of thy coming,  
Back to me under (*in*) full victory."  

41\. O.— His form and his beauty changed,  
And showers of tears dropped down,  
Till (they) wet his breast and his bright countenance,  
And (he) said, "My woe (art) thou, O Oisin, (going) from me."  

42\. O Patrick 'twas sorrowful (was) the story,  
Our separating from each other there,—  
(The) separation of the father with his own son  
'Tis melancholy, weak and faint to be at its narrating, (*telling it*).  

43\. I kissed my father gently (and) kindly.  
And the same (mark of) aifection I received from him,  
I left safety (*bade farewell*) all to the Fiann  
And the tears dropped down by my cheeks.  

44\. 'Tis many a happy day I was [myself] and Fionn,  
And the Fiann in our company under (*in*) full power,  
Playing (at) chess and drinking.  
And hearing music,— (we) the host (which) was valiant.  

45\. Hunting in smooth (-sloped) valleys,  
And our hunting-dogs of sweet mouth with us there.  
Another while [for us] in rough conflict  
Felling heroes full boldly.  

45 a. P.— O vain Oisin, desist for a while,  
From (narrating) thy great bravery on (of) the Fiann,  
How wentst thou to (the) land of the young  
And continue for us without deceit [on] thy story.  

46\. O.— We gave (*turned*) our back to the land,  
And our face directly due-west,  
The smooth sea ebbed before us,  
And filled in its billows in our track.  

47\. We saw wonders in our travel,  
Cities, courts and castles,  
White-limed (*white-washed*) mansions and fortresses,  
Brilliant royal seats and palaces.  

48\. We saw also by our side  
A hornless deer on leap (*leaping*) nimble,  
And a red-eared white hunting-dog  
Barking boldly in [the] chase.  

49\. We also beheld without deceit, (*in truth*)  
A young woman on a brown [steed] horse,  
An apple of gold in her right hand,  
And she a-going on (the) top of the waves.  

50\. We saw (also) in her wake,  
A young rider on a white steed,  
Under a purple red cloak of satin  
And a gold-headed sword in his right hand.  

51\. Who (are) they, the pair yonder, whom I see,  
O gentle queen, tell to me (the) reason,—  
That woman most beautiful (of) countenance,  
And (the) sleek rider of the white steed " ?  

52\. N.— Put not regard in what thou wilt see,  
O humble Oisin, (nor) in what thou sawest yet.  
There is [not] in them all but nothing  
Till we reach [to] (the) land of (the; King of the young"  

53\. O.— We saw from us afar  
A sunny palace (of) polished front,  
[Was] fairest (in) form and appearance.  
Of (all) which were in the world to be found.  

54\. " What (is) the royal fortress exceeding fair,  
And also the loveliest [of what] eye hath seen,—  
In (*towards*) which we are proceeding ia its meeting (*approaching towards it*),  
Or who is high-prince there ? "  

55\. N.— "(The) daughter of (the) king of (the) Land of the living,  
Is queen yet in the fortress,  
(Whom) Fomhor Builleach of Dromloghach took  
With him by violence of arms and activity.  

56\. " Obligations she put on the brave.  
Without (not) a wife to make of her for ever,  
Till she should find a champion or a true hero  
Who would stand (in) strife with him hand on (*to*) hand."  

57\. O.— "Take success and blessing, O Niamh of (the) head of gold, (*golden-hair*)  
I never heard (anything) of music better  
Than the gentle melodious voice of thy sweet mouth,  
And great is the sorrow with us (*we feel for*) a woman of her condition.  

58\. " Let us go now to her knowing (*to make her acquaintance*) to the fortress,  
And (it) may be possible that for us it is in destiny  
That mighty hero to fall by me  
In feats of activity as was (the) custom" (with me).  

59\. We went then to the fortress,  
And came unto us the young queen,  
It was equal (the) radiance to her and to the sun.  
And she put (*expressed*) a hundred welcomes before us,  

60\. There was raiment of yellow silk  
On the queen who was most beautiful (in) aspect,  
Her fair skin like (the) swan on (the) wave,  
And her two cheeks were [on] (*of* the) colour of the rose.  

61\. [On] the colour of [the] gold was her hair,  
And her clear blue eyes (were) without a cloud,  
Her small mouth of honey (was) [on] (the) colour of the berries,  
And her slender brow of chiselled mould.  

62\. We sat then down,  
Each one of us on a chair of gold,  
Was laid (down) unto us much food.  
And drinking-horns (which) were filled with *beoir*,  

63\. When we had taken our sufficiency of food,  
And many (of) sweet wines of (*for*) drinking,  
Spoke the gentle, young queen,  
'Tis this she said, Hearken to me [for] a while.  

64\. (She) told us (the) knowledge and cause of her grief,  
And the tears dropped down by her cheek,  
(She) said that there was not a return for her to her own country,  
And the mighty giant to be living.  

65\. ).— "Be in thy silence (*silent*), O young queen,  
Cease from thy grief and be not weeping,  
And I give to thee my hand,  
The giant of slaughter that (he) shall fall by us."  

66\. R.— (There) is not a hero now to be found  
Though bravest in repute under the sun,  
Who would give single-fight, hand on (*to*) hand,  
To the bold giant of the hard strokes."  

67\. O.— " I tell to thee, O kind queen  
That (it is) not fearful with me (*in my estimation*) his coming in my meeting (*to meet me*)  
(And) if he shall not fall from the vigour of my arms,—  
That I myself shall fall for thy protection."  

68\. 'Twas not long till we saw coming.  
The powerful giant (who) was greatest in hideousness  
A bundle (was) on him of skins of deer,  
And a spindle- pole of iron in his hand.  

69\. (He) saluted not and bowed not to us.  
But looked in the countenance of the young woman,  
Proclaimed battle and mighty single fight,  
And I went myself in his meeting, (*to meet him.*)  

70\. For (the) space (of) three nights and three days,  
We were in the vigorous contest,  
Though powerful was [he] the vaHant giant,  
I took off his head without delay.  

71\. When the two (of) young women saw  
The great giant (lying) weakly (*dead*) in (the) midst, (*on the ground*)  
They let (forth) three shouts of exultation  
With great boasting and gladness  

72\. We went then to the fortress,  
And I was bruised, weak (and) faint,  
Dropping (of) blood full freshly (*copiously*)  
Coming closely out of my wounds.  

73\. The daughter of (the) King of the living came  
Truly relieving (on) myself,  
(She) put balm and balsam in my wounds,  
And I [myself] was hale after her,  

74\. We consumed our meal pleasantly,  
And 'twas merry for us (the time) then after it,  
(There) were prepared for us in the fortress  
Warm beds of (the) down of the birds.—  

75\. We [ourselves] put (*buried*) the big man  
In a grave sod deep, wide and level,  
I raised his flag-stone over his monument.  
And I wrote his name in Ogham-Craobh.  

76\. On the morrow on sight of day,  
We awoke out of our slumber,  
"It is time for us," quoth (the) daughter of the king,  
(To) proceed without rest to our own country."  

77\. We prepared [on] us without stay,  
And we took our leave with (*of*) the virgin,  
Sad and sorrowful were we after her,  
And (it) was not less so for the refulgent woman after us, (*she was equally so*).  

78\. (There is) not knowledge to me, O mild Patrick !  
What happened to the young queen  
From the day we both parted with her  
Or whether she (herself) returned to (the) Land of the living.  

78a\. P — Thou told'st not to us, O pleasant Oisin,  
What the country (was) in which thou wast thyself ;  
Show to us now its name—  
And follow again (the) course of thy story.  

78b\. O.— (The) Land of Victories (is) that country,  
And indeed no lie (is) the name.  
If there is glory in Heaven (such) as was there,  
To God, with good-will I would give invocation (*praise*).  

79\. We gave (*turned*) our back to the fortress,  
And our horse under us under (*in*) full course.  
And [that] it was swifter with the whiie steed, (*the white steed was swifter*)  
Than the wind of March on (the) ridge of a mountain.  

80\. 'Twas not long till the sky darkened,  
And till wind rose in every point,  
The great sea shone strongly  
And (there) was not a sight of (the) sun to be found.  

81\. A while for us (was passed) beholding the clouds,  
And [on] the stars (which) were under mist,  
The storm abated, and the wind,  
And Phoebus shone over our heads.  

82\. We saw by our side,  
A most delightful country under (*in*) full bloom,  
And plains, beautiful, level (and) fine  
And a royal fortress (which) was exceeding fair.  

83\. (There) was not a colour of (those) which eye hath seen.  
Of fresh blue, of green and white,—  
Of purple, crimson, and of yellow.  
That was not in this royal mansion I am saying (*speaking of*)  

84\. There were on the other side of the fortress  
Radiant royal-seats and palaces ;  
Made all of precious stones,  
By the hands of sages and free (*clever*) artists.  

85\. 'Twas not long till we saw coming unto us,  
Proceeding from the fortress in our meeting (*to meet us*)  
Three fifties of champions (who) were best (in) activity,  
Elegance, fame and highest (in) repute.  

86\. O.— What (is) the beautiful country [it] yonder,  
O meek daughter of the clusters (*ringlets*) of gold,  
Fairest (of) aspect of what eye hath seen  
Or whether (is) [it] that (the) Land of the young ?"  

87\. N.— " It is indeed, O generous Oisin,  
I told not to thee a lie to its side, (*concerning it*)  
There is not a thing of what I promised to thyself  
That is not manifest to thee perpetually."  

88\. O.— There came unto us in its wake (*after that*)  
A hundred young women most beautiful (in) comeliness,  
Under (*attired in*) garments of silk filled with gold,  
Welcoming [before] us to their own country.  

89\. We saw again coming  
A troop of a chosen bright host.  
And a noble, powerful, brave king  
Most excellent (in) grace, form, and countenance.  

90\. There was a yellow shirt of silk of satin,  
And a bright golden garment over its head, (*over it*)  
There was a sparkling crown of [the] gold,  
Brightly glittering on his head.—  

91\. We saw coming after him,  
The young queen [was] highest (in) repute,  
And fifty ladies sweet (and) good—  
Who were fairest (of) form in her company.  

92\. At (*on*) coming of them all on one spot  
Spoke mildly the King of the young,  
And said "This is Oisin son of Fionn  
The gentle spouse of Niamh of (the) head of gold."  

93\. He took [on] me then by (the) hand,  
And said aloud for the host,—  
R.— " O brave Oisin ! O son of the King !  
A hundred thousand welcomes before thee !  

94\. This country into which thou camest,  
I will not conceal (its) tidings on thee, without deceit.  
Long and lasting is thy life,  
And thou thyself shalt be ever young.  

95\. (There) is not a delight for (*on*) which the heart meditated.  
That is not in this country under (*in*) thy presence,  
O Oisin, believe from me truly.  
That I (am) king of (the) Land of the young—  

96\. At this (*here*) (is) the kind queen.  
And my own daughter Golden-headed Niamh,  
Who went beyond (the) smooth sea for thy sake (*for thee*)  
To be as a spouse to her for ever."  

97\. O.— I gave thanks with (*unto*) the king,  
And I bowed down to the good queen,  
(It) was not stopped there, quickly with us (*We went our way* quickly )  
Till we reached (thej royal mansion of (the) King of the young.  

98\. (There) came (the) nobles of the fine city  
Both man and woman in our meeting (*to meet us*)  
(There) was a banquet and feast there continually  
During ten nights and ten days.  

99\. I was married with (*to*) Niamh of (the) head of gold,  
O, Patrick from Rome of the white croziers,  
That as (*is how*) I went to the Land of the young  
Though sad and sorrowful (it seems) with (*to*) me to treat (of).  

99a\. P.— Continue for us further [on] thy tale,  
O Oisin of gold of the arms of slaughter,  
How didst thou leave (the) Land of the young  
It is yet long (it seems) with (*to*) me till thou disclosest the cause.  

99b\. Tell to us now with great pleasure,  
Whether (there) were any children to thee by Niamh,  
Or whether long (the time) thou wast in (the) Land of the young,  
Narrate without sorrow to us thy story.—  

100\. O.— There were to me by Niamh (of the) head of gold,  
Of children (who) were excellent in grace and elegance,  
Best (in) form, shape and countenance,  
Two (of) young sons and a gentle daughter.  

100a\. P.— O pleasant Oisin follow [to] thy story,  
And tell [to] us where are thy children,  
Give [to] us, without delay, their name  
And the country in which they are [there].  

101\. O.— (There) was with Niamh under (*in*) their presence (*for them*),  
The Land of the Young, of the Living, and of the Victories,  
A wreath and crown of (the) kingly gold  
And many jewels (of) which I make not [to] mention,  

102\. Niamh gave on (*to*) my two (of) sons,  
(The) name of my father and of my good son  
Illustrious Fionn,— head of the hosts,  
And Osgar of gold of (the) red arms.  

103\. I myself gave to my gentle daughter,—  
With consent of Niamh of the golden head,  
From virtue of her beauty and her loving countenance,  
The true name,— Plur-na-mban.  

101\. I spent a period long protracted.  
Three hundred years and more  
Till I thought that it would be my desire  
Fionn and the Fiann to see alive.  

105\. I myself asked leave on (*of*) the king,  
And on (*of*) my gentle spouse, golden-headed Niamh,  
(To) go to Erin back again,  
To see Fionn and his great host.  

106\. N.— "Thou wilt get leave from me" quoth the gentle daughter  
"Though sad (be) the story with (*to*) me you to be to its mentioning (*saying it*)  
For fear that there might not (be) a coming for thee again with (*during*) thy existence, (*that thou mightst not be able to come*),  
To my own country. O victorious Oisin."  

107\. O.— What is (the) fear to us, O blooming queen,  
And the white steed to be under my will,  
He will teach the knowledge (*way*) [to] me with ease,  
And (I) will return safe back unto thyself."  

108\. N.— " Remember, O Oisin ! what I am saying,  
If thou layest foot on level ground.  
That (there is) not a coming for thee [ever] again for ever,  
To this beautiful country in which I am [my] self.  

109\. "I say with (*to*) thee again, without deceit,  
If thou even descendest off the white steed.  
That thou wilt never (-more) come to the Land of the young  
O Oisin of gold of the valiant arms.  

110\. "I say with (*to*) thee for the third time  
If (there) is a coming off (*if thou comest off*) the steed for thyself.  
That thou wilt be [in thy] (a) withered, blind old man,  
Without nimbleness, without merriment, without speed, without (a) leap,—  

111\. 'Tis grievous with (it seems) (*to*) me, O loving Oisin,  
Thou (to) go to green Erin for ever,  
She is not now as (she) was,  
And thou shalt never see Fionn of the hosts.  

112\. "There is not now in all Erin,  
But a father of orders and hosts of saints,  
O loving Oisin, this (*here*) (is) my kiss  
Thou shalt never return to the Land of the young."  

113\. O. I looked up in her countenance with pity,  
And (there) dropped from my eyes floods of tears,  
O Patrick! it would have been pitiful with thee (to see her  
Tearing (the) hair of the head of gold (*golden hair*).  

114\. She put me under severe obligations,  
(To) go and come without touching [with] (the) lea (land)  
And said with (*to*) me by virtue of their essence,  
If I should break them that I would not return safe.  

115\. I promised [to] her each thing without a lie,  
That I would myself fulfil what she said with (*to*) me,  
I went on (the) back of the white steed  
And I left (*bade*) farewell at (*to*) (the) people of the fortress.  

116\. I kissed my gentle spouse,  
And 'twas melancholy we (were) at parting with her,  
My two (of) sons and my young daughter,  
Were under (*in*) sorrow shedding tears.  

117\. I prepared [on me] for travelling,  
And I gave (*turned*) my back to (the) Land of the young,  
The steed ran swiftly under me,  
As (he) did (before) with me and golden-headed Niamh.  

118\. Our story is not narrated fully (*there is nothing related of our adventures*),  
Of everything of what occurred with (*to*) myself,  
Until I came again back  
To green Erin of the many jewels.  

119\. O Patrick, of the orders and of the saints  
I never told a lie to thee yet.  
That (*there*) (is) to thee (the) cause of my story,  
And as (*how*) I left the Land of the young.—  

120\. If I should be myself, O Patrick !  
Like (*as*) I was that day (it) self  
I would put thy clergy all (together) to death.  
And a head on a neck (there) would not be after me.  

121\. If I got sufficiency of [the] bread.  
As I used to get every time from Fionn,  
I would pray unto (the) king of [the] graces,  
Thee to be safe over its head (*master of it*).  

121a\. P.— Thou wilt get bread and drink  
Without any fault now from myself.  
Melodious with (*to*) myself is (the) voice of thy mouth,  
And follow for us still [on] thy story.  

122\. O. On coming of myself then in (to the) country  
I looked round in every [all] point,  
I thought then truly,  
That (there) was not an account of Fionn [to me] to be got.  

123\. 'Twas not long for me and ('twas) not distant,  
Till (I) saw from the west coming towards me  
A great cavalcade both men and women.  
And they came in (to) my own presence,  

124\. They saluted [to] me gently and mildly,  
And wonder seized each one of them  
On seeing (of the) size of my [own] person.  
(Of) my form, my appearance, and my countenance.  

125\. I inquired myself then of them [there]  
Whether they heard Fionn to be alive, (*if Finn was living*) ?  
Or whether lived any other of the Fiann,  
Or what it (was) the calamity which touched (*happened*) [to] them?  

126\. S. "We heard tell on (*of*) Fionn,  
For strength, for activity, and for bravery,  
That (there) was not ever his like [there],  
In person, in fame, and in mind.  

127\. "Many is (the) book written down  
At (*by*) sweet melodious sages (of the) Gael,  
Which (are) not clear with us to narrate to thee, truly,  
On (the) deeds of Fionn, and on the Fiann.  

128\. "We have heard that Fionn had  
A son (who) was radiant in elegance and mould  
That a young woman came for his sake,  
And that (he) went with her to (the) Land of the young."  

129\. O. When I heard myself that discourse  
That Fionn lived not nor one of the Fiann,  
I took weariness and great grief.  
And full melancholy was I after them.  

130\. I did not stop then from the course,—  
Quickly and swiftly without any delay  
Till I gave (*set*) my face, clear, level, (*straight*)  
For renowned broad Almhuin of Leinsber.  

131\. Great was my wonder there,  
That I saw not (the) court of Fionn of the hosts,  
There was not in its place there, truly,  
But weeds, chick-weed, and nettle.  

132\. Alas, O Patrick ! and alas, my woe !  
'Twas sad the visit [it] (was) at (*to*) myself  
Without tidings of Fionn or of the Fiann,  
Which left me under pain with my duration, (*during my life*)  

133\. P. O Oisin ! cease now from thy grief.  
Shed thy tears for (the) God of [the] graces,  
Fionn and the Fiann are weak enough,  
And there is not their relieving (*no helping them*) for ever.  

134\. O. 'Twere great the pity [that] O Patrick,  
Fionn for ever to be in pain,  
Or what [it the] pursuing-party (which) took victory on him,  
And (considering) the number of hardy heroes (that) fell by himself.—  

135\. P.— It is God who gained victory on Fionn,  
And not strength of enemies or (of) valiant hands,  
And on the Fiann all like him  
In hell condemned to their eternal tormenting.  

136\. O.— O Patrick ! direct me in (*to*) the place  
In which Fionn is in hand (captive) and the Fiann,  
And there is not a hell or a heaven,  
Which would put them under subjection.  

137\. If 'tis there that Osgar my own son, is.  
The hero (who) was bravest in heavy conflict,  
(There) was not made in hell, or in the Heaven of God,  
A host of what size (soever) that (he) would not overcome.  

138\. P.— Let us desist from our controversy on each side,  
And follow (of) thy story, O valiant Oisin !  
What happened to thee afterwards,  
After the Fiann to be (*were*) on (the) ground (*down*).  

139\. O.— I myself will tell that to thee, O Patrick !  
After me to leave (*after I had left*) Almhuin of Leinster,  
(There) was not one habitation in which the Fiann were, (at any time)  
That I searched not eagerly without any delay,  

140\. On my taking of me (*going*) through *Gleann-an-Smoil*,  
I saw a great gathering there.  
Three hundred men and [what was] more  
Were before me in the valley.  

141\. A man of the crowd spoke.  
And he said of (*with*) a voice, aloud,  
D.— " Come to our assistance O kingly hero,  
And deliver us from [the] hardship."  

142\. O.— I came then (in) to (their) presence.  
And (there was) a large flag of marble with the host  
(The) weight of the flag was down upon them,  
And its putting (*to put it*) off them upward was not possible with them, (*they were unable*).  

143\. The portion of them which was under the flag below,  
They were to their oppressing (*being oppressed*) weakly.  
With (the) weight of the great load,—  
Many of them lost their memory (*senses*).  

144\. D.— A man of the stewards spoke,  
And said, " O kingly young champion^  
Forthwith deliver [on] my host,  
Or a man of them will not be alive" !  

145\. O.— 'Tis shameful the deed now to say (*to be obliged to say*),  
And (considering) the number of men which is there,  
That it came not with (*was not possible for*) (the) strength of the host  
This flag (to) lift full vigorously,  

146\. If Osgar son of Oisin could live,  
(He) would catch [on] this flag in his right hand,  
(He) would put it for (*in*) a cast over the host,  
Not a lie is becoming for me now to say.  

147\. I lay on my right side,  
And I caught (hold) on the flag in my hand.  
By (the) strength and [by] activity of my arms  
I put it seven perches from its place !  

148\. Through (the) need (*pressure*) of the full (*very*) large flag,  
The girth of gold of the white steed broke,  
I came down full fastly  
On (the) sole of my two feet on the lea (land).  

149\. No sooner came I down,  
Than the white steed took fright  
(He) went then to depart  
And I under hurt (*disabled*) weakly and faint.  

150\. I lost (the) sight of my eyes.  
My form, my countenance, and my brightness,  
I was [in my] (an) old man, poor (and) bhnd,  
Without vigour, without memory, without regards  

151\. O Patrick, that (*there*) (is) to thee my story.  
As happened to myself without deceit,  
My going and my progress fully.  
And my coming back from (the) Land of the young.
