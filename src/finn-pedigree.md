# Fionn's Pedigree

The legend of Fionn Mac Cumhaill typically seems to start with Fionn, orphaned by the loss of his father, being taken by his mother to a place a safety, lest the members of the clann Morna, who killed Fionn's father, sought also to put paid to any claim Fionn might have on the leadership.

But just in case there is some colour we can add to our tale in accounts that describe the death of Fionn's father, Uail (Cumhaill, "Cool"), or perhaps his mother, Muirne's, backstory, let's see what some rather more literal translations of the source material have to say.

We begin with a translation by Kuno Meyer from 1904, around the time that Lady Gregory published _"Gods and fighting men"_. Several footnotes cite `O'D.`, which refers to an earlier translation of the same source maerial by John O'Donovan, which we shall also meet below.

THE BOYISH EXPLOITS OF FINN MAC CUMHAILL.

EDITED BY JOHN O'DONOVAN, LL.D., M.R.I.A.

PRINTED FOR THE OSSIANIC SOCIETY.

Letter addressed by Dr. John O'Donovan, to the President of the Ossianic Society.

Dublin, Dec. 27th, 1858.

Dear Sir— Having, at your request, undertaken to translate into English — to lengthen out the abbreviations, and to fix the grammatical endings of the contracted words, in this notice of the boyish exploits of the celebrated Finn Mac Cumhaill, the Fingal of Mac Pherson's Ossian, — I beg to offer you a few obserrations on the age and importance of the little tract, as well as of the manuscript from which it has been taken. This tract was copied letter for letter, and contraction for contraction from a fragment of the Psalter of Cashel now preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford (*Laud.* 610), by the Rev. Euseby D. Cleayer, M. A., of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1854, and now curate of S. Barnabas, Pimlico, London, whose progress in the study of the Irish language is truly wonderful, considering the slight advantages of oral instruction which he has possessed. He has copied this little tract so faithfully that I was able to understand it as well as if I had the original manuscript before me. No artist ever copied a portrait or inscription more accurately. This manuscript was examined in the year 1844 by the Rev. Dr. Todd, S.F.T.C.D., who published a full account of its contents in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. 2, p. 336, sq. `[archive.org:proceedingsofroy02proc]` In 1846 I examined it again with the most anxious care, and published a brief notice of its more important contents in the introduction to Leabhar na g-Ceart. It consists of 292 pages folio, vellum, and was transcribed in 1453 by John Boy O'Clery and others at Pottlerath, in the barony of Crannagh, and county of Kilkenny, for Edmund Butler, the head of the sept of Mac Richard, who afterwards became Earls of Ormonde. This manuscript remained in the possession of Mac Richard Butler till the year 1462, when Ormonde aod he were defeated in a battle fought at Baile-an-phoill, now Pilltown, in the barony of Iverk, county of Kilkenny, by Thomas, Earl of Desmond, to whom he was obliged to give up this very copy of the Psalter of Cashel, together with another manuscript (now unknown), called the Book of Carrick-on-Suir. This fact appears from a memorandum on foL 110, p. b, of which the followiog is a literal translation :—

" This was the Psalter of Mac Richard Butler, until the defeat at Baile-an phoill, was giren to the Earl of Ormonde, and to Mac Richard by the Earl of Desmond (Thomas), when this book and the book of Carrick, were obtained in the redemption of Mac Richard ; and it was this Mac Richard that had these books transcribed for his own use ; and they remained in his possession until Thomas, Earl of Desmond, wrested them from him."

The foregoing memorandum was written in the manuscript, while it was in the possession of Thomas, Earl of Desmond, whose name " Thomas, of Desmond," appears in English, in his own hand, on fol. 92, a., See *Leahhar na g-Ceart*, Introduction, pp. xxviii—xxx. The publication of this manuscript, as it stands, would be a great desideratum in Irish literature, and I trust that Sir John Romilly will not think it unworthy of his attention.

I am of opinion that this little tract is of great antiquity, and contains, perhaps, the oldest account we have remaining of Finn and his cotemporaries. You will observe that the style is extremely simple, and altogether devoid of that redundancy of epithets which characterises the prose compositions of later ages, which are equalled only by those of _"Ei famoso Feliciano de Silva."_

The celebrated Irish antiquary, Duald Mac Firbis, in his genealogical work, pp. 435, 436, gives various pedigrees of the famous Irish hero, Finn Mac Cumhaill. Some deduce his descent from the Orbhraighe of Druim Inmocht, others from the Coroo Oiche, a sept of the ni-Fidhgeinte, who were seated in the present county of Limerick. Some state that he sprung fh>m the Ui-Tairsigh of Ui-Failghe, a plebeian sept, while other genealogists maintain that he came of the Ui-Tairsigh of the Luaighni Teamhrach of Fera-Cul in Bregia, which was one of the three septs from whom the chief leader of the Fians, or Irish militiai was elected. Mac Firbis, however, states that this discrepancy must have arisen from mistaking one Finn for another ; but that by far the greater number of the authentic Irish authorities agree in deducing the pedigree of the famous Finn Mac Cumhaill from Nuada Neacht, the fourth son of Sedna Sithbhaic, the ancestor of the kings of Leinster.

By the mother's side, Finn Mac Cumhaill was descended from Tadhg, son of Nuadhat, son of Aice, son of Daite, son of Brocan, son of Fintan of Tuath-Daite in Bregia. This Mac Firbis believes to be his true maternal descent, though others state that his mother was Torba, daughter of Echuman of the Ernaans of Dun-Cearmna (the old head of Kinsale, in the county of Cork), and that he had a half-brother by the mother's side, who was called Finn Mac Gleoir.

Mac Firbis adds that Finn Mac Camhaill possessed, in right of his office of leader of the Fians, seven hallys, or townlands, out of every tricha-ched, or hundred, in Ireland ; that he was bom in the third year of the reign of Conn of the Hundred Battles, and died in the year 283.

Some genealogical books give the pedigree of our hero thus : — Finn, son of Cumhall, son of Trénmor, son of Subalt, son of Ealtan, son of Baiscne, son of Nuada Necht : others, Finn, son of Cumhall, son of Baiscne, son of Trénmor, son of Ferdarath, son of Goll, son of Forgall, son of Daire, son of Deaghaidh, son of Sin ; but of the yarious pedigrees of our hero which Mac Firbis has copied from Irish authorities, the following is the only one that can be considered authentic : —

1. Nuada Necht,

2. Fergus Fallge, ancestor of the Kings of Leinster,

3. Boesa Buadh, 3. So-alt,

4. Finn, the poet, king of Leinster, 4. Alt,

5. Conchobhar Abhraruadh, 5. Cairbre Qarbhroin,

6. Moghcorb, king of Leinster, 6. Baeiscne,

7. Cucorb, king of Leinster, 7. Modh,

8. Nia Corb, 8. Buan,

9. Cormac Gealtagaoith, 9. Fergus,

10. Feilimidh Firurglais, 10. Trendorn,

11. Cathaeir Mor (A.D., 177.), monarch of Ireland, 11. Trenmor,

12. Cumhall,

13. Finn Mac Cumhaill, sl. 284.

He had a sister named *Sidh*, who was proverbial in Ireland for her fleetness of foot, and who was the mother of Caoilte Mac Ronain, also famous in the Fenian tales for his agility. He had another sister, Seogen, who was the mother of Cobhthach, son of Crunnchu.

I have always believed that Finn Mac Cumhaill was a real historical personage, and not a myth or god of war, like the Hercules of the Greeks, the Odin of the Scandinavians, or the Siegfried of the Germans. He was the son-in-law of the famous Cormac Mac Airt monarch of Ireland, and the general of his standing army. He was slain in the year A.D., 284, according to the Annals of Tighemach, a period to which our authentic history unquestionably reaches. (See Ogygia, part iii, c. 70).

This celebrated warrior was, as we have seen, of the regal line of the kings of Leinster, of the Milesian or Scotic race (for my ingenious friend Mr. Herbert F. Hore has theorised in vain to prove him of Scandinavian origin) ; he had two residences in Leinster, one at Allen ( Almhain,) in the present county of Kildare, and the other at Moyelly in the (now) King's County, both of which descended to him from his ancestors. Pinkerton, the most critical and sceptical writer that has ever treated of Irish and Scottish history, has the following remarkable words, in which he expresses his conviction of Finn's undoubted historical existence : —

" He seems," says he, "to have been a man of great talents for the age, and of celebrity in arms. His formation of a regular standing army, trained to war, in which all the Irish accounts agree, seems to have been a rude imitation of the Roman legions in Britain. The idea, though simple enough, shows prudence, for such a force alone, could have coped with the Romans had they invaded Ireland. But this machine, which surprised a rude age, and seems the basis of all Finn's fame, like some other great schemes, only lived in its author, and expired soon after him." — Inquiry into the History of Scotland, vol. ii, p. 77.

Our own poet and historian, Moore, who read all that had been written by the Mac Phersons and the modern critics on the history of Finn, expresses his conviction that he was a real man of flesh and blood, and no god of war or poetical creation. He concludes his account of him in tlie following poetical strain.

" It has been the fate of this popular Irish hero, after a long course of traditional renown in his country, where his name still lives, not only in legends and songs, but yet in the more indelible record of scenery connected with his memory, to have been all at once transferred by adoption to another country (Scotland), and start under a new but false shape, into a fresh career of fame." — History of Ireland, vol. i. p. 133.

The only known descendants of our hero, now known to exist, are the Dal-Cais Le. O'Briens of Munster and their correlatives. Cormac Gas, king of Munster, who married Samhair (Samaria), the daughter of Finn by Gráinè, daughter of Cormac Mac Airt, monarch of Ireland, and had by her, according to the Irish genealogists, three sons, Tinnè and Connla, of whose race nothing is known, and Fearcorb, the progenitor of the Dal Cais, the hereditary enemies of the race of Conn of the Hundred Battles. After the death of Finn, the monarch Cairbre Liffechair, son of Cormac, the grandson of Conn of the Hundred Battles, disbanded and outlawed the Clanna-Baeiscnè, of whom Finn was then the head, and retained in his service their enemies, the Clanna-Morna, a military tribe of the Firbolgs of Connacht. The Clanna-Baeiscè then repaired to Munster to their relative, Fearcorb, who retained them in his service, contrary to the orders of the Irish monarch. This led to the bloody battle of Gabhra (near the Boyne in Meath), in which the two rival military tribes slaughtered each other almost to extermination. In the heat of the action, Oscar, the grandson of Finn (and son of Oisin,) met the monarch in single combat ; but fell, and the monarch retiring from the combat, was met by his own relative Semeon, one of the Fotharta, (a tribe that had been expelled into Leinster) who fell upon him after being severely wounded in the dreadful combat with Oscar, and despatched him by a single blow.

Oisin and Caeilte Mac Ronain survived all the followers of our hero, and are fabled to have lived down to the time of St. Patrick (A.D. 432), to whom they related the wonderful exploits of Finn and his cotemporaries. This, however, is incredible ; but it is highly probable that both lived to converse with some Christian missionaries who preceded the great apostle of Ireland, and who found it difficult to convert them from their pagan notions.

There is a very curious dialogue, partly preserved in the book of Lismore, and partly in a MS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, said to have been carried on between Caeilte, son of Ronan, and St. Patrick. This dialogue, notvithstanding ita anachronism, or perhaps rather misnomer, is of great value to the Irish linguist, topographer, and antiquary, on account of the curious ancient forms of the language which it preserves, and the various forts, mounds, sepulchres, plains, mountains, estuaries and rivers which it mentions by their primitive and mediaeval names.

Hoping that this tract will soon see the light under your auspices, as President of our Society,

I remain, dear Sir,

Yours very truly,

JOHN O'DONOVAN.

To

William Smith O'Brien, Esq.  
*President of the Ossianic Society.*

The translation then follows. We note that in the translation of the pernultimate stanza of the song claimed to be sung about Fionn and the sons of Morna, the footnote only provides a geohraphical, rather than explanatory context regarding their final meeting at Teamhair Luachra (Tara Luachra in Kuno Meyer's account). Which is to say: no mention of the pigs, that we will hear about from another translated poem.
