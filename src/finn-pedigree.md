# Fionn's Pedigree

The legend of Fionn Mac Cumhaill typically seems to start with Fionn, orphaned by the loss of his father at the Battle of Cnuchna, being taken by his mother to a place a safety, lest the members of the clann Morna, who killed Fionn's father, Uiall / Cumhaill, sought also to put paid to any claim Fionn might have on the leadership.

But just in case there is some colour we can add to our tale in accounts that describe the death of Fionn's father, Uail (Cumhaill, "Cool"), or perhaps his mother, Muirne's, backstory.

The gist of the story seems to be this:

> Conn fell in love with Muirna of the fair neck, daughter of Tadhg, and elopes with her. Tadg appeals to Conn of the Hundred Battles, who tells Cumhall to leave Ireland or return Muirne. Conn sent Urgriu and Morna Wryneck (along with Morna's sone, Aed) into batlle at Cnuchna. Luchet wounded Aed, blinding him in one eye, from which he gets his name, Goll (one-eyed). Goll then killed Cumhall. But Muirne was pregnant with Cumhall's child...

So let's see what some rather more literal translations of the source material have to say. We begin with a translation by Kuno Meyer from 1904, around the time that Lady Gregory published _"Gods and fighting men"_. Several footnotes cite `O'D.`, which refers to an earlier translation of the same source maerial by John O'Donovan, which we shall also meet below.

*The following translation includes not just a summary of the causes and outcome of the battle of Cnuchna, but also the birth of Fionn, his childhood exploits and his defeat of Aillen, following which he took on the leadership of the Fianna and won Goll's allegiance.*

THE BOYISH EXPLOITS OF FINN MAC CUMHAILL.

EDITED BY JOHN O'DONOVAN, LL.D., M.R.I.A.

CORRESPONDING MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, BERLIN. 

DUBLIN :

PRINTED FOR THE OSSIANIC SOCIETY.

1859. 


Letter addressed by Dr. John O'Donovan, to the President of the Ossianic Society.

Dublin, Dec. 27th, 1858.

Dear Sir— Having, at your request, undertaken to translate into English — to lengthen out the abbreviations, and to fix the grammatical endings of the contracted words, in this notice of the boyish exploits of the celebrated Finn Mac Cumhaill, the Fingal of Mac Pherson's Ossian, — I beg to offer you a few observations on the age and importance of the little tract, as well as of the manuscript from which it has been taken. This tract was copied letter for letter, and contraction for contraction from a fragment of the Psalter of Cashel now preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford (*Laud.* 610), by the Rev. Euseby D. Cleayer, M. A., of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1854, and now curate of S. Barnabas, Pimlico, London, whose progress in the study of the Irish language is truly wonderful, considering the slight advantages of oral instruction which he has possessed. He has copied this little tract so faithfully that I was able to understand it as well as if I had the original manuscript before me. No artist ever copied a portrait or inscription more accurately. This manuscript was examined in the year 1844 by the Rev. Dr. Todd, S.F.T.C.D., who published a full account of its contents in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. 2, p. 336, sq. `[archive.org:proceedingsofroy02proc]` In 1846 I examined it again with the most anxious care, and published a brief notice of its more important contents in the introduction to Leabhar na g-Ceart. It consists of 292 pages folio, vellum, and was transcribed in 1453 by John Boy O'Clery and others at Pottlerath, in the barony of Crannagh, and county of Kilkenny, for Edmund Butler, the head of the sept of Mac Richard, who afterwards became Earls of Ormonde. This manuscript remained in the possession of Mac Richard Butler till the year 1462, when Ormonde aod he were defeated in a battle fought at Baile-an-phoill, now Pilltown, in the barony of Iverk, county of Kilkenny, by Thomas, Earl of Desmond, to whom he was obliged to give up this very copy of the Psalter of Cashel, together with another manuscript (now unknown), called the Book of Carrick-on-Suir. This fact appears from a memorandum on fol. 110, p. b, of which the followiog is a literal translation :—

" This was the Psalter of Mac Richard Butler, until the defeat at Baile-an phoill, was given to the Earl of Ormonde, and to Mac Richard by the Earl of Desmond (Thomas), when this book and the book of Carrick, were obtained in the redemption of Mac Richard ; and it was this Mac Richard that had these books transcribed for his own use ; and they remained in his possession until Thomas, Earl of Desmond, wrested them from him."

The foregoing memorandum was written in the manuscript, while it was in the possession of Thomas, Earl of Desmond, whose name " Thomas, of Desmond," appears in English, in his own hand, on fol. 92, a., See *Leahhar na g-Ceart*, Introduction, pp. xxviii—xxx. The publication of this manuscript, as it stands, would be a great desideratum in Irish literature, and I trust that Sir John Romilly will not think it unworthy of his attention.

I am of opinion that this little tract is of great antiquity, and contains, perhaps, the oldest account we have remaining of Finn and his cotemporaries. You will observe that the style is extremely simple, and altogether devoid of that redundancy of epithets which characterises the prose compositions of later ages, which are equalled only by those of _"Ei famoso Feliciano de Silva."_

The celebrated Irish antiquary, Duald Mac Firbis, in his genealogical work, pp. 435, 436, gives various pedigrees of the famous Irish hero, Finn Mac Cumhaill. Some deduce his descent from the Orbhraighe of Druim Inmocht, others from the Coroo Oiche, a sept of the ni-Fidhgeinte, who were seated in the present county of Limerick. Some state that he sprung from the Ui-Tairsigh of Ui-Failghe, a plebeian sept, while other genealogists maintain that he came of the Ui-Tairsigh of the Luaighni Teamhrach of Fera-Cul in Bregia, which was one of the three septs from whom the chief leader of the Fians, or Irish militiai was elected. Mac Firbis, however, states that this discrepancy must have arisen from mistaking one Finn for another ; but that by far the greater number of the authentic Irish authorities agree in deducing the pedigree of the famous Finn Mac Cumhaill from Nuada Neacht, the fourth son of Sedna Sithbhaic, the ancestor of the kings of Leinster.

By the mother's side, Finn Mac Cumhaill was descended from Tadhg, son of Nuadhat, son of Aice, son of Daite, son of Brocan, son of Fintan of Tuath-Daite in Bregia. This Mac Firbis believes to be his true maternal descent, though others state that his mother was Torba, daughter of Echuman of the Ernaans of Dun-Cearmna (the old head of Kinsale, in the county of Cork), and that he had a half-brother by the mother's side, who was called Finn Mac Gleoir.

Mac Firbis adds that Finn Mac Camhaill possessed, in right of his office of leader of the Fians, seven hallys, or townlands, out of every tricha-ched, or hundred, in Ireland ; that he was bom in the third year of the reign of Conn of the Hundred Battles, and died in the year 283.

Some genealogical books give the pedigree of our hero thus : — Finn, son of Cumhall, son of Trénmor, son of Subalt, son of Ealtan, son of Baiscne, son of Nuada Necht : others, Finn, son of Cumhall, son of Baiscne, son of Trénmor, son of Ferdarath, son of Goll, son of Forgall, son of Daire, son of Deaghaidh, son of Sin ; but of the yarious pedigrees of our hero which Mac Firbis has copied from Irish authorities, the following is the only one that can be considered authentic : —

1. Nuada Necht,

2. Fergus Fallge, ancestor of the Kings of Leinster,

3. Boesa Buadh, 3. So-alt,

4. Finn, the poet, king of Leinster, 4. Alt,

5. Conchobhar Abhraruadh, 5. Cairbre Qarbhroin,

6. Moghcorb, king of Leinster, 6. Baeiscne,

7. Cucorb, king of Leinster, 7. Modh,

8. Nia Corb, 8. Buan,

9. Cormac Gealtagaoith, 9. Fergus,

10. Feilimidh Firurglais, 10. Trendorn,

11. Cathaeir Mor (A.D., 177.), monarch of Ireland, 11. Trenmor,

12. Cumhall,

13. Finn Mac Cumhaill, sl. 284.

He had a sister named *Sidh*, who was proverbial in Ireland for her fleetness of foot, and who was the mother of Caoilte Mac Ronain, also famous in the Fenian tales for his agility. He had another sister, Seogen, who was the mother of Cobhthach, son of Crunnchu.

I have always believed that Finn Mac Cumhaill was a real historical personage, and not a myth or god of war, like the Hercules of the Greeks, the Odin of the Scandinavians, or the Siegfried of the Germans. He was the son-in-law of the famous Cormac Mac Airt monarch of Ireland, and the general of his standing army. He was slain in the year A.D., 284, according to the Annals of Tighemach, a period to which our authentic history unquestionably reaches. (See Ogygia, part iii, c. 70).

This celebrated warrior was, as we have seen, of the regal line of the kings of Leinster, of the Milesian or Scotic race (for my ingenious friend Mr. Herbert F. Hore has theorised in vain to prove him of Scandinavian origin) ; he had two residences in Leinster, one at Allen ( Almhain,) in the present county of Kildare, and the other at Moyelly in the (now) King's County, both of which descended to him from his ancestors. Pinkerton, the most critical and sceptical writer that has ever treated of Irish and Scottish history, has the following remarkable words, in which he expresses his conviction of Finn's undoubted historical existence : —

" He seems," says he, "to have been a man of great talents for the age, and of celebrity in arms. His formation of a regular standing army, trained to war, in which all the Irish accounts agree, seems to have been a rude imitation of the Roman legions in Britain. The idea, though simple enough, shows prudence, for such a force alone, could have coped with the Romans had they invaded Ireland. But this machine, which surprised a rude age, and seems the basis of all Finn's fame, like some other great schemes, only lived in its author, and expired soon after him." — Inquiry into the History of Scotland, vol. ii, p. 77.

Our own poet and historian, Moore, who read all that had been written by the Mac Phersons and the modern critics on the history of Finn, expresses his conviction that he was a real man of flesh and blood, and no god of war or poetical creation. He concludes his account of him in the following poetical strain.

" It has been the fate of this popular Irish hero, after a long course of traditional renown in his country, where his name still lives, not only in legends and songs, but yet in the more indelible record of scenery connected with his memory, to have been all at once transferred by adoption to another country (Scotland), and start under a new but false shape, into a fresh career of fame." — History of Ireland, vol. i. p. 133.

The only known descendants of our hero, now known to exist, are the Dal-Cais Le. O'Briens of Munster and their correlatives. Cormac Gas, king of Munster, who married Samhair (Samaria), the daughter of Finn by Gráinè, daughter of Cormac Mac Airt, monarch of Ireland, and had by her, according to the Irish genealogists, three sons, Tinnè and Connla, of whose race nothing is known, and Fearcorb, the progenitor of the Dal Cais, the hereditary enemies of the race of Conn of the Hundred Battles. After the death of Finn, the monarch Cairbre Liffechair, son of Cormac, the grandson of Conn of the Hundred Battles, disbanded and outlawed the Clanna-Baeiscnè, of whom Finn was then the head, and retained in his service their enemies, the Clanna-Morna, a military tribe of the Firbolgs of Connacht. The Clanna-Baeiscè then repaired to Munster to their relative, Fearcorb, who retained them in his service, contrary to the orders of the Irish monarch. This led to the bloody battle of Gabhra (near the Boyne in Meath), in which the two rival military tribes slaughtered each other almost to extermination. In the heat of the action, Oscar, the grandson of Finn (and son of Oisin,) met the monarch in single combat ; but fell, and the monarch retiring from the combat, was met by his own relative Semeon, one of the Fotharta, (a tribe that had been expelled into Leinster) who fell upon him after being severely wounded in the dreadful combat with Oscar, and despatched him by a single blow.

Oisin and Caeilte Mac Ronain survived all the followers of our hero, and are fabled to have lived down to the time of St. Patrick (A.D. 432), to whom they related the wonderful exploits of Finn and his cotemporaries. This, however, is incredible ; but it is highly probable that both lived to converse with some Christian missionaries who preceded the great apostle of Ireland, and who found it difficult to convert them from their pagan notions.

There is a very curious dialogue, partly preserved in the book of Lismore, and partly in a MS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, said to have been carried on between Caeilte, son of Ronan, and St. Patrick. This dialogue, notvithstanding ita anachronism, or perhaps rather misnomer, is of great value to the Irish linguist, topographer, and antiquary, on account of the curious ancient forms of the language which it preserves, and the various forts, mounds, sepulchres, plains, mountains, estuaries and rivers which it mentions by their primitive and mediaeval names.

Hoping that this tract will soon see the light under your auspices, as President of our Society,

I remain, dear Sir,

Yours very truly,

JOHN O'DONOVAN.

William Smith O'Brien, Esq.  
*President of the Ossianic Society.*

The translation then follows. We note that in the translation of the pernultimate stanza of the song claimed to be sung about Fionn and the sons of Morna, the footnote only provides a geohraphical, rather than explanatory context regarding their final meeting at Teamhair Luachra (Tara Luachra in Kuno Meyer's account). Which is to say: no mention of the pigs, that we will hear about from another translated poem.

## The Battle of Cnucha

The Battle of Cnucha ; a médiéval Irish text, with a translation, by W. M. Hennessy
W. M. Hennessy, 1875

pp.86-91

THE BATTLE OF CNUCHA.

[The principal value of the following story from *Lebor na huidre*, an Irish Ms. written circa A. D, 1100, is that it presents probably the oldest written form of one important fragment of the legendary history so widely extended among the Celtic family in the British Islands, in which Find mac Cumhaill (or Fingal) occupies the part of principal hero, and Oisin, or Ossian, the part of narrator. The style of the narrative, so terse and simple, is in favourable contrast with the prosy, redundant, oftentimes absurdly bombastic compositions of a later period, and justifies the opinion of scholars that it was written some centuries earlier than the date of the Ms. from which the present text has been copied. The language, also, is singularly pure; on which account care has been taken to print in different type the portions of words represented by abbreviations in the original.

The admirers of Mac Pherson's ambitious attempt to localize the Ossianic legend within the narrow limits of North Britain, now happily through the growth of a more independent and unselfish spirit of criticism fast becoming fewer in number, will see with surprise that all the characters in this most ancient fragment of the literature of which he would rob all other branches of the Celtic race, are purely Irish. The places mentioned are likewise Irish. But though the Irish may justly claim to have nursed Find, or at least to have stood to him in the traditional relationship of God-parents, they cheerfully allow all their tribal connections (and foremost among them the Scotch people) to share the glory of his manhood.

There are other versions of the birth and origin of Find Mac Cumhaill, some of which are noticed in Campbell's *Leabhar na Feinne*, vol. I. pp. 33, 34, etc.; but all are of much later date. The most important of these is the tract pubiished by the late Dr O'Donovan, from a fifteenth century Ms., in the *Transactions of the Ossianic Society*, vol. IV. (Dublin, 1859), on the " Boyish Exploits of F. m. C. " Dr O'Donovan, like most other Irish antiquaries, regarded Find Mac Cumhaill as a genuine historical personage, who resided mostly at *Almhu* in the County of Kildare, but possessed another residence at a place called Magh-Elle (now Moyelly) in the adjoining King's County. That a person named Find Mac Cumhaill did live at the time indicated (3rd cent.) I do not deny. But it is as certain that his history has degenerated into a pure myth, as that there is now no trace of a dun or fortress on the hill of *Almu*, or Allen.

In autumn last I had the pleasure of visiting the hill of Allen with Mr. J. F. Campbell, the indefatigable and enlightened coUector of Ossianic legends, and although we were shewn the thicket out of which Find's hounds, Bran and Sceolán, are still fabled to start nightly, to the alarm of late wayfarers, we could find no trace of such a *dun* as is referred to in the following tract. The hill is almost a bare rock, on which materials to erect a *dun* or even a *rath* are now scarcely obtainable. But beautifuUy situated in the midst of a lovely country, over which it commands a wide prospect, it was well adapted for a place of assembly, or for the chase.

The allusion to Tadg's command that Find's mother should be burned is curious. The existence of the practice of burning women for incontinency among the Celts of Britain and Ireland is borne out by other references in ancient tracts. But the discussion of the question hère would extend this note beyond reasonable limits. — W. M. Hennessy.]

THE CAUSE OF THE BATTLE OF CNUCHA `[*Cnucha.* The place now called Castleknock (in Irish *Caislen-Cnucha*), on the river Liffey, near Dublin, where there is a remarkable tumulus. Some good copies of the old Irish taie called " the battle of Cnucha ", a tale well worthy of publication, are in the collection of the Royal Irish Academy.]` HERE :

When Cathair Mór `[*Cathair Mor*. Cathair the Great. As the name Cathair is now generally anglicised " Charles, " Cathair Mor might be rendered as "Charlemagne. " The Four Masters give his obit under A. D. 122, which would be much too early for the chronology of the Fingalian era. O'Flaherty, who refers the death of Cathair Mor to A. D. 177 (*Ogygia*, pp. 310-12) is nearer to the mark.]`, son of Fedelmith Fir-urglais, son of Cormac Gelta-gaith, was in the kingship of Temhair `[*Temhair*. Now Tara, co Meath.]` and Conn Ced-chathach `[*Conn Ced-chathach*. Hundred-battled Conn. Obiit A. D. 197 (O'Flaherty).]` in Cenandos, in (the) rigdomna's land, Cathair had a celebrated druid, to wit, Nuadu son of Achi, son of Dathi, son of Brocan, son of Fintan, of Tuath-Dathi in Bregas `[*Brega*. A district anciently comprising the greater part of the present county of Meath, aud portions of Westmeath and Dublin counties.]`. The druid was soliciting land in Laigen `[*Laigen*. Lagenia, or Leinster, which province did not anciently include any of the counties north of Dublin county. The expression illaignib means " in Lageniensibus "; for Irish writers in speaking of the provinces, regarded the people, not the districts inhabited by them.]` from Cathair; for he knew that it was in Laigen his successorship would be.

Cathair gave him his choice of land. The land the druid chose was Almu `[*Almu. Now the hill of Allen, near Newbridge in the county of Kildare.]`.

She that was wife to Nuadhu was Almu, daughter of Becan.

A dûn was built by the druid then in Almu, and *alamu* `[*Alamu*. Some kind of colouring stuff.]` was rubbed to its wall, until it was ail white; and perhaps it was from that ,the name) ' Almu ' was applied to it; of which was said :

> All-white is the *dún* of battle renown  
> As if it had received the lime of Ireland;  
> From the aîamu which he gave to his house  
> Hence it is that ' Almu ' is applied to Almu.

Nuadu's wife, Almu, was entreating that her name might be given to the hill; and that request was granted to her, to wit, that her name should be upon the hill; for it was in it she was buried afterwards; of which was said :

> Almu — beautiful was the woman ! —  
> Wife of Nuadhu the great, son of Achi.  
> She entreated — the division was just —  
> That her name (should be) on the perfect hill.

Nuadu had a distinguished son, to wit, Tadhg son of Nuadhu. Rairiu, daughter of Dond-duma, was his wife. A celebrated druid, also, (was) Tadg.

Death came to Nuadu `[*Death came to Nuadu*. An unusual way, in Irish, of saying that Nuadu died. The ordinary form would be *fuair Nuadu bas*  lit. " N. found death. "]`; and he left his *dún*, as it was, to his son ; and it is Tadg that was druid to Cathair in the place of his father.

Rairiu bore a daughter to Tadhg, i e. Murni Muncaim `[*Murni Muncaim* lit. Murni "of the fair neck ". The dimin. of *Murni* (*murnin*, pron. *moorneen*) is a term of endearment still applied to girls by the Irish-speaking people.]` her name.

This maiden grew up in great beauty, so that the sons of the kings and mighty lords of Ireland were wont to be courting her.

Cumall, son of Trenmor, king-warrior of Ireland, was then in the service of Cond `[*In the service of Cond*. The original is *fri laim cuind*; lit. " ad manus Quinti. "]`. He also, like ever every other person, was demanding the maiden. Nuadu gave him a refusal, for he knew that it was on account of him Cumall he would have to leave Almu `[*To leave Almu*. The original of the clause " he would have to leave Almu " (*no biad scarad do fri Almain*), literally translated, would read " there would be separation for him with Almu. "]`.

The same woman `[*Woman*. She is described, in the Irish genealogical tracts, as "Baine, daughter of Scal Balb, king of the Fomori, i. e. of Finland ". See the Account of the celebrated women of Ireland, in the Book of Lecan, fol. 184 sq.]` was mother to Cumhall and to Cond's father, to wit, Fedelmid Rechtaide.

Cumall cornes, however, and takes Murni by force, in elopement with him, since she had not been given to him. Tadg comes to Cond, and relates to him his profanation by Cumall, and he began to incite Cond, and to reproach him.

Cond dispatches messengers to Cumall, and ordered him to leave Ireland, or to restore his daughter to Tadhg. Cumall said he would not give her; but everything he would give, and not the woman. Cond sent his soldiers, and Urgrend son of Lugaid Corr king of Luagni `[*Luagni*, or *Luagni Temrach*. A sept seated near Tara, in the present county Meath.]`, and Daire Derc son of Eochaid, and his son Aed (who was afterwards called Goll `[*Goll*, i. e. blind. Vid. O'Donovan's suppl. to *O'Reilly*, in voce.]`) to attack Cumall. Cumall assembles his army against them; and the battle of Cnucha is fought between them, and Cumall is slain there, and a slaughter of his people is effected.

Cumall fell by Goll son of Morna. Luchet wounded Goll in his eye, so that he destroyed his eye. And hence it is that (the name) "Goll " attached to him ; whereof was said :

> Aed was the name of Daire's son,  
> Until Luchet of fame wounded him;  
> Since the heavy lance wounded him,  
> Therefore, he has been called Goll.

Goll killed Luchet. It is for that reason, moreover, that a hereditary feud existed between the sons of Morna and Find.

Dairi had two names, to wit, Morna and Dairi.

Murni went, after that, to Cond; for her father rejected her, and did not let her (come) to him, because she was pregnant; and he said to his people to burn her `[*To burn her*. Many instances occur in Irish taies of the existence of the practice of burning women for adultery. In the story of Corc Mac Lugdach (Book of Leinster, fol. 206, a, 2), we read, *Ba bés itossaig nach ingen dognid bais dar cenn a urnaidm do breothad. " It was the custom at first to burn any woman who committed lust in violation of her compact.]`. And nevertheless, he dared not (compass) her destruction against Cond.

The girl was asking of Cond how she should act. Cond said: " Go, " said he, " to Fiacal son of Concend, to Temhair-Mairci, and let thy delivery be effected there " : (for a sister to Cumall was Fiacal's wife, Bodball Bendron).

Condla, Cond's servant, went with her, to escort her, until she came to Fiacal's house, to Temhair-Mairci. Welcome was given to the girl then; and her arrivai there was good. The girl was delivered afterwards, and bare a son; and Demni was given as a name to him.

The boy is nursed by them, after that, until he was capable of committing plunder on every one who was an enemy to him. He then proclaims battle or single combat against Tadg, or else the full *eric* of his father to be given to him. Tadg said that he would give him judgement therein. The judgement was given; and this is the judgement that was given to him, to wit, that Almu, as it was, should be ceded to him for ever, and Tadg to leave it. It was done so. Tadg abandoned Almu to Find, and came to Tuath-Dathi, to his own hereditary land; and he abode in Cnoc-Réin, which is called Tulach-Taidg `[*Tulach-Taidg*. " Tadg's hill." The situation of this place, which must be in Meath, has not yet been satisfactorily determined.]` today; for it is from him it has been called Tulach-Taidg frora that time to this, So that hence was said this :

> Find demands from Tadg of ihe towers,  
> For killing Cumall the great,  
> Battle, without respite, without delay,  
> Or that he should obtain single combat.  
> Because Tadg was not able to sustain battle  
> Against the high prince,  
> He abandoned to him, it was for him enough,  
> Almu altogether, as it stood.

Find went afterwards to Almu, and abode in it. And it is it that was his principal residence whilst he lived.

Find and Goll concluded peace after that ; and the eric of his father was given by the Clann-Morna to Find. And they lived peacefully, until (a quarrel) occurred between the min Temhair-Luachra `[*Temhair-Luachra*. " Temhair of Luachair ". Luachair, or Luachair-Dedad, was the ancient name of the hilly district stretching between the counties of Limerick and Kerry. the latter of which is still called Ciarraighe-Luachra by the Irish-speaking people of Munster. The word " Temhair," the etymology of which is yet uncertain, enters into the composition of many topographical names in Ireland.]`, regarding the Slanga-pig `[*Slanga-pig*.
