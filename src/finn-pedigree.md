# Fionn's Pedigree

The legend of Fionn Mac Cumhaill typically seems to start with Fionn, orphaned by the loss of his father, being taken by his mother to a place a safety, lest the members of the clann Morna, who killed Fionn's father, sought also to put paid to any claim Fionn might have on the leadership.

But just in case there is som colour we can add to our tal that stems from the death of Fionn's father, or perhaps his mother's backstory, let's hear the tale of how his father, Uail (Cumhaill, "Cool"), lost his life at the battle of Cnuchna, killed by Goll mac Morna, who also lost an eye at the same time.

The Battle of Cnucha ; a médiéval Irish text, with a translation, by W. M. Hennessy

pp.86-91

THE BATTLE OF CNUCHA.

[The principal value of the following story from *Lebor na huidre*, an Irish Ms. written circa A. D, 1100, is that it presents probably the oldest written form of one important fragment of the legendary history so widely extended among the Celtic family in the British Islands, in which Find mac Cumhaill (or Fingal) occupies the part of principal hero, and Oisin, or Ossian, the part of narrator. The style of the narrative, so terse and simple, is in favourable contrast with the prosy, redundant, oftentimes absurdly bombastic compositions of a later period, and justifies the opinion of scholars that it was written some centuries earlier than the date of the Ms. from which the présent text has been copied. The language, also, is singularly pure; on which account care has been taken to print in different type the portions of words represented by abbreviations in the original.

The admirers of Mac Pherson's ambitious attempt to localize the Ossianic legend within the narrow limits of North Britain, now happily through the growth of a more independent and unselfish spirit of criticism fast becoming fewer in number, will see with surprise that all the characters in this most ancient fragment of the literature of which he would rob all other branches of the Celtic race, are purely Irish. The places mentioned are likewise Irish. But though the Irish may justly claim to hâve nursed Find, or at least to have stood to him in the traditional relationship of God-parents, they cheerfully allow all their tribal connections (and foremost among them the Scotch people) to share the glory of his manhood.

There are other versions of the birth and origin of Find Mac Cumhaill, some of which are noticed in Campbell's *Leabhar na Feinne*, vol. I. pp. 33, 34, etc.; but all are of much later date. The most important of thèse is the tract pubiished by the late Dr O'Donovan, from a fifteenth century Ms., in the *Transactions of the Ossianic Society*, vol. IV. (Dublin, 1859), on the " Boyish Exploits of F. m. C. " Dr O'Donovan, like most other Irish antiquaries, regarded Find Mac Cumhaill as a genuine historical personage, who resided mostly at *Almhu* in the County of Kildare, but possessed another residence at a place called Magh-Elle (now Moyelly) in the adjoining King's County. That a person named Find Mac Cumhaill did live at the time indicated (3rd cent.) I do not deny. But it is as certain that his history has degenerated into a pure myth, as that there is now no trace of a dun or fortress on the hill of *Almu*, or Allen.

In autumn last I had the pleasure of visiting the hill of Allen with Mr. J. F. Campbell, the indefatigable and enlightened coUector of Ossianic legends, and although we were shewn the thicket out of which Find's hounds, Bran and Sceolán, are still fabled to start nightly, to the alarm of late wayfarers, we could find no trace of such a *dun* as is referred to in the following tract. The hill is almost a bare rock, on which materials to erect a *dun* or even a *rath* are now scarcely obtainable. But beautifuUy situated in the midst of a lovely country, over which it commands a wide prospect, it was well adapted for a place of assembly, or for the chase.

The allusion to Tadg's command that Find's mother should be burned is curious. The existence of the practice of burning women for incontinency among the Celts of Britain and Ireland is borne out by other references in ancient tracts. But the discussion of the question hère would extend this note beyond reasonable limits. — W. M. Hennessy.]


THE CAUSE OF THE BATTLE OF CNUCHA `[1]` HERE :

When Cathair Mór `[2]`, son of Fedelmith Fir-urglais, son of Cormac Gelta-gaith, was in the kingship of Temhair 5`[3]` and Conn Ced-chathach `[4]` in Cenandos, in (the) rigdomna's land, Cathair had a celebrated druid, to wit, Nuadu son of Achi, son of Dathi, son of Brocan, son of Fintan, of Tuath-Dathi in Bregas `[5]`. The druid was soliciting land in Laigen`[6]` from Cathair; for he knew that it was in Laigen his successorship would be.

Cathair gave him his choice of land. The land the druid chose was Almu `[7]`.

She that was wife to Nuadhu was Almu, daughter of Becan.

A dûn was built by the druid then in Almu, and *alamu* `[8]` was rubbed to its wall, until it was ail white; and perhaps it was from that ,the name) ' Almu ' was applied to it; of which was said :

> All-white is the *dún* of battle renown  
> As if it had received the lime of Ireland;  
> From the aîamu which he gave to his house  
> Hence it is that ' Almu ' is applied to Almu.

Nuadu's wife, Almu, was entreating that her name might be given to the hill; and that request was granted to her, to wit, that her name should be upon the hill; for it was in it she was buried afterwards; of which was said :

> Almu — beautiful was the woman ! —  
> Wife of Nuadhu the great, son of Achi.  
> She entreated — the division was just —  
> That her name (should be) on the perfect hill.

Nuadu had a distinguished son, to wit, Tadhg son of Nuadhu. Rairiu, daughter of Dond-duma, was his wife. A celebrated druid, also, (was) Tadg.

Death came to Nuadu`[9]`; and he left his *dún*, as it was, to his son ; and it is Tadg that was druid to Cathair in the place of his father.

Rairiu bore a daughter to Tadhg, i e. Murni Muncaim `[10]` her name.

This maiden grew up in great beauty, so that the sons of the kings and mighty lords of Ireland were wont to be courting her.

Cumall, son of Trenmor, king-warrior of Ireland, was then in the service of Cond `[11]`. He also, like ever every other person, was demanding the maiden. Nuadu gave him a refusal, for he knew that it was on account of him Cumall he would have to leave Almu `[12]`.

The same woman `[13]` was mother to Cumhall and to Cond's father, to wit, Fedelmid Rechtaide.

Cumall cornes, however, and takes Murni by force, in elopement with him, since she had not been given to him. Tadg comes to Cond, and relates to him his profanation by Cumall, and he began to incite Cond, and to reproach him.

Cond dispatches messengers to Cumall, and ordered him to leave Ireland, or to restore his daughter to Tadhg. Cumall said he would not give her; but everything he would give, and not the woman. Cond sent his soldiers, and Urgrend son of Lugaid Corr king of Luagni `[14]`, and Daire Derc son of Eochaid, and his son Aed (who was afterwards called Goll `[15]`) to attack Cumall. Cumall assembles his army against them; and the battle of Cnucha is fought between them, and Cumall is slain there, and a slaughter of his people is effected.

Cumall fell by Goll son of Morna. Luchet wounded Goll in his eye, so that he destroyed his eye. And hence it is that (the name) "Goll " attached to him ; whereof was said :

> Aed was the name of Daire's son,  
> Until Luchet of famw wounded him;  
> Since the heavy lance wounded him,  
> Therefore, he has been called Goll.

Goll killed Luchet. It is for that reason, moreover, that a hereditary feud existed between the sons of Morna and Find.

Dairi had two names, to wit, Morna and Dairi.

Murni went, after that, to Cond; for her father rejected her, and did not let her (come) to him, because she was pregnant; and he said to his people to burn her `[16]`. And nevertheless, he dared not (compass) her destruction against Cond.

The girl was asking of Cond how she should act. Cond said: " Go, " said he, " to Fiacal son of Concend, to Temhair-Mairci, and let thy delivery be effected there " : (for a sister to Cumall was Fiacal's wife, Bodball Bendron).

Condla, Cond's servant, went with her, to escort her, until she came to Fiacal's house, to Temhair-Mairci. Welcome was given to the girl then; and her arrivai there was good. The girl was delivered afterwards, and bare a son; and Demni was given as a name to him.

The boy is nursed by them, after that, until he was capable of committing plunder on every one who was an enemy to him. He then proclaims battle or single combat against Tadg, or else the full *eric* of his father to be given to him. Tadg said that he would give him judgement therein. The judgement was given; and this is the judgement that was given to him, to wit, that Almu, as it was, should be ceded to him for ever, and Tadg to leave it. It was done so. Tadg abandoned Almu to Find, and came to Tuath-Dathi, to his own hereditary land; and he abode in Cnoc-Réin, which is called Tulach-Taidg `[17]` today; for it is from him it has been called Tulach-Taidg frora that time to this, So that hence was said this :

> Find demands from Tadg of ihe towers,  
> For killing Cumall the great,  
> Battle, without respite, without delay,  
> Or that he should obtain single combat.  
> Because Tadg was not able to sustain battle  
> Against the high prince,  
> He abandoned to him, it was for him enough,  
> Almu altogether, as it stood.

Find went afterwards to Almu, and abode in it. And it is it that was his principal residence whilst he lived.

Find and Goll concluded peace after that ; and the eric of his father was given by the Clann-Morna to Find. And they lived peacefully, until (a quarrel) occurred between the min Temhair-Luachra `[18]`, regarding the Slanga-pig `[19]`, when Banb-Sinna son of Maelenaig was slain; of which was said :

> Afterwards they made peace —  
> Find and Goll of mighty deeds —  
> Until Banb-Sinna was slain
> Regarding the pig, in Temhair-Luachra. 

1. *Cnucha.* The place now called Castleknock (in Irish *Caislen-Cnucha*), on the river Liffey, near Dublin, where there is a remarkable tumulus. Some good copies of the old Irish taie called " the battle of Cnucha ", a tale well worthy of publication, are in the collection of the Royal Irish Academy.

2. *Cathair Mor*. Cathair the Great. As the name Cathair is now generally anglicised " Charles, " Cathair Mor might be rendered as "Charlemagne. " The Four Masters give his obit under A. D. 122, which would be much too early for the chronology of the Fingalian era. O'Flaherty, who refers the death of Cathair Mor to A. D. 177 (*Ogygia*, pp. 310-12) is nearer to the mark.

3. *Temhair*. Now Tara, co Meath.

4. *Conn Ced-chathach*. Hundred-battled Conn. Obiit A. D. 197 (O'Flaherty).

5. *Brega*. A district anciently comprising the greater part of the present county of Meath, aud portions of Westmeath and Dublin counties.

6. *Laigen*. Lagenia, or Leinster, which province did not anciently include any of the counties north of Dublin county. The expression illaignib means " in Lageniensibus "; for Irish writers in speaking of the provinces, regarded the people, not the districts inhabited by them.

7. *Almu. Now the hill of Allen, near Newbridge in the county of Kildare.

8. *Alamu*. Some kind of colouring stuff.

9. *Death came to Nuadu*. An unusual way, in Irish, of saying that Nuadu died. The ordinary form would be *fuair Nuadu bas*  lit. " N. found death. "

10. *Murni Muncaim* lit. Murni "of the fair neck ". The dimin. of *Murni* (*murnin*, pron. *moorneen*) is a term of endearment still applied to girls by the Irish-speaking people.

11. *In the service of Cond*. The original is *fri laim cuind*; lit. " ad manus Quinti. "

12. *To leave Almu*. The original of the clause " he would hâve to leave Almu " (*no biad scarad do fri Almain*), literally translated, would read " there would be separation for him with Almu. "

13. *Woman*. She is described, in the Irish genealogical tracts, as "Baine, daughter of Scal Balb, king of the Fomori, i. e. of Finland ". See the Account of the celebrated women of Ireland, in the Book of Lecan, fol. 184 sq.

14. *Luagni*, or *Luagni Temrach*. A sept seated near Tara, in the present county Meath.

15. *Goll*, i. e. blind. Vid. O'Donovan's suppl. to *O'Reilly*, in voce.

16. *To burn her*. Many instances occur in Irish taies of the existence of the practice of burning women for adultery. In the story of Corc Mac Lugdach (Book of Leinster, fol. 206, a, 2), we read, *Ba bés itossaig nach ingen dognid bais dar cenn a urnaidm do breothad. " It was the custom at first to burn any woman who committed lust in violation of her compact.

17. *Tulach-Taidg*. " Tadg's hill." The situation of this place, which must be in Meath, has not yet been satisfactorily determined.

18. *Temhair-Luachra*. " Temhair of Luachair ". Luachair, or Luachair-Dedad, was the ancient name of the hilly district stretching between the counties of Limerick and Kerry. the latter of which is still called Ciarraighe-Luachra by the Irish-speaking people of Munster. The word " Temhair," the etymology of which is yet uncertain, enters into the composition of many topographical names in Ireland.

19. *Slanga-pig*. The Slanga-pigs, like the *mucca Drebrend*, or " pigs of Drebriu, " and the *mucca Manannain*, or " pigs of Manannan " (the Irish Neptune), were magical swine, which reappeared as often as they were killed and eaten. Irish romance is full of them; and in an account preserved in the Book of Fermoy, fol. 215, b. 2, it is stated that the last Slanga-pig distributed to the men of Ireland, satisfied 25 battalions!
