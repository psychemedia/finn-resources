Whilst the main focus of this resource is on the tales and legends 
surrounding the Fianna in the time of Fionn MacCumhaill, it also helps to 
know a little of what happened *before* that time, particularly the 
circumstances surrounding the death of Fionn's father, which had so much 
to do with how the early years of Fionn's life played out.
