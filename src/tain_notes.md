Another story connected with the same cycle, the Echtra Nerai, Adventures of Nera, otherwise called the Tain Bo A ingen, Cattle raid of Aingen, `[Edited and translated by Professor K. Meyer in Revue Celtique , x. 212 sqq., from the MSS. in T. C. D. — H. 2, 16 and Eg. 17S2.]` may receive mention here as presenting a feature which frequently recurs in the ecclesiastical visions, while the main outlines of the story are preserved in modern folk-tales. As Ailill, king of Connacht, was keeping the Samhain festival in his rath of Cruachan, he offered to give his gold-hilted sword to any one who should dare to put a withe on the foot of a newly hanged man, who was swinging outside. Nera accepted the challenge, and after several vain attempts (the withe springing off of its own accord) succeeded. The corpse then spoke, and asked Nera for a drink, and Nera obligingly took the corpse on his shoulders, and offered to take him to a house which appeared hard by, standing amid a lake of fire. The corpse declined this offer, which is hardly to be wondered at, and the rest of the story follows the conventional lines of the ordinary folk-tale, but we have here the moat of fire, as in the Fis Adamndin and elsewhere.

The Echtra Nerai or the 'Adventures of Nera' (see this study, p. 287), contains a description like the one above, of how a mortal named Nera went into the S^W/j^-palace at Cruachan ; and it is said that he went not only into the cave • (uamh) but into the sid of the cave. The term uamh or cave, according to Mr. Borlase, indicates the whole of the interior ' vaulted chamber, while the sid of that vaulted chamber ' or uamh is intended to refer to ' the sanctum sanctorum, or penetralia of the spirit-temple, upon entering into which the mortal came face to face with the royal occupants, and there doubtless he lay fasting, or offering his sacrifices, at the : periods prescribed'.^ The word hrugh refers simply to the appearance of a tumulus, or souterrain beneath a fort or rath, and means, therefore, mansion or dwelling-place. ^ And Mr. Borlase adds : — * I feel but little doubt that in the inner chamber at New Grange, with its three recesses and^ its basin, we have this sid of the cave, and the place where the pilgrims fasted — a situation and a practice precisely similar to those which, under Christian auspices, were continued at such places as the Leaba Mologa in Cork, the original Patrick's Purgatory in Lough Derg, and elsewhere. The practice of lying in stone troughs was a feature of the Christian pilgrimages in Ireland. Sometimes such troughs had served the previous purpose of stone coffins. It is just-possible that the shallow basins in the cells at Lough Crew, New Grange, and Dowth may, like the stone beds or troughs of the saints,^ have been occupied by the pilgrims engaged > in their devotions. If so, however, they must have sat in them in Eastern fashion.' 


p287-9

In two of the more ancient Irish texts, the Echtra Nerai ^ or * Expedition of Nera ', a preliminary tale in the introduction to the Tain ho Cuailnge or * Theft of the Cattle of Cuailnge '  ...  no reasonable doubt whatever about the Tuatha De Danann or Sidhe being a race Hke what we call spirits. The first text describes how Ailill and Medb in their palace of Cruachan celebrated the feast of Samain (November Eve, a feast of the dead even in pre-Christian times). Two culprits had been executed on the day before, and their bodies, according to the ancient Irish custom, were left hanging from a tree until the night of Samain should have passed; for on that night it was dangerous to touch the bodies of the dead while demons and the people of the Sidhe were at large throughout all Ireland, and mortals found near dead bodies at such a time were in great danger of being taken by these spirit hosts of the Tuatha De Danann. And so on this very night, when thick darkness had settled down, Ailill desired to test the courage of his warriors, and offered his own gold-hilted sword to any young man who would go out and tie a coil of twisted twigs around the leg of one of the bodies suspended from the tree. After many had made the attempt and failed, because unable to brave the legions of demons and fairies, Nera alone succeeded; but his success cost him dear, for he finally fell under the power both of the dead man, round whose legs he had tied the coil, and of an elfin host: with the dead man's body on his back, Nera was obliged to go to a strange house that the thirst of the dead man might be assuaged therein; and the dead man in drinking scattered 'the last sip from his lips at the faces of the people that were in the house, so that they all died'. Nera carried back the body; and on returning to Cruachan he saw the fairy hosts going into the cave, 'for the fairy-mounds of Erinn are always opened about Halloween.' Nera followed after them until he came to their king in a palace of the Tuatha De Danann, seemingly in the cavern or elsewhere underground; where he remained and was married to one of the fairy women. She it was who revealed to Nera the secret hiding-place, in a mysterious well, of the king's golden crown, and then betrayed her whole people by reporting to Nera the plan they had for attacking Ailill's court on the Halloween to come. Moreover, Nera was permitted by his fairy wife to depart from the sid; and he in taking leave of her asked: 'How will it be believed of me that I have gone into the sid.' 'Take fruits of summer with thee,' said the woman. 'Then he took wild garlic with him and primrose and golden fern.' And on the following November Eve when the sid of Cruachan was again open, 'the men of Connaught and the black hosts of exile' under Ailill and Medb plundered it, taking away from it the crown of Briun out of the well. But 'Nera was left with his people in the sid, and has not come out until now, nor will he come till Doom.'

All of this matter is definitely enough in line with the living Fairy-Faith: there is the same belief expressed as now about November Eve being the time of all times when ghosts, demons, spirits, and fairies are free, and when fairies take mortals and marry them to fairy women ; also the beliefs that fairies are living in secret places in hills, in caverns, or under ground — palaces full of treasure and open only on November Eve. In so far as the real fairies, the Sidhe, are concerned, they appear as the rulers of the Feast of the Dead or Samain, as the controllers of all spirits who are then at large ; and, allowing for some poetical imagination and much social psychology and anthropomorphism, elements as common in this as in most literary descriptions concerning the Tuatha De Danann, they are faithfully enough presented

Echtra Nerai

THE ADVENTURES OF NERA

The following taie, now printed for the first time, seems to have been variously known as the Echtra Nerai or the Tâin BéAingen. See Jubainville, Catalogne, pp. 124 and 213. Under the former title it is mentioned in LL. 245 b, 32, as one of the remscélà or introductory taies of the Tâin Bô Cuailnge ; the latter title it bears in one of the two copies that hâve corne down tous, viz. that in H. 2. 16, col. 658-662. The other copy, preserved in Egerton 1782, fo. 7ib-73b, is without a heading.

The Echtra Nerai is closely connected with the Tâin Bô Regamna (referred to in the text, 1. 169), which may be regarded as an épisode of it. One of the incidents of the taie is referred to in the bodv of the Tâin Bô Cuailnge, see note on

I.175.

An analysis of part of the Echtra Nerai is foundin O'Curry, Manners III. pp. 199-201, and Hennessy has quoted some extracts from it in the Revue Celtique, I. p. 44.

The two MSS. give the same text and clearly go back to one archetypus. Neither of them can have been copied from the other, as mistakes caused by homoioteleuta occur in both at different places. See 11. 52, 87, 108, 142.

I have printed the text of Egerton as it stands, because it is more carefully written than that of H. 2. 16, and because of its peculiar orthography. The various readings, but not the orthographical deviations, of H. 2. 16 are given at the foot of the pages, later additions and corrections by the hand of a different scribe and in paler ink being enclosed in parentheses.

THE ADVENTURES OF NERA

i. One Halloween Ailill and Medb were in Rath Craachan with their whole household. They set about cooking food. Two captives had been hanged by them the day before that. Then Ailil said: "He who would now put a withe round the foot of either of tbe two captives that are on the gallows shall have a prize for it from me, as he may choose".

2. Great was the darkness of that night and its horror, and demons would appear on that night always. Each man of them went out in turn to try that night, and quickly would he come back into the house. "I will have the prize from thee", said Nera, "and I shall go out. Truly thou shalt have this my gold-hilted sword here", said Ailill.

3. Then this Nera went out towards the captives, and put good armour on him. He put a withe round the foot of one of the two captives. Thrice it sprang off again. Then the captive said to him, unless he put a proper peg on it, though he be at it till the morrow, he would not fix his own peg on it. Then Nera put a proper peg on it.

4. Said the captive from the gallows to Nera: "That is manly, o Nera!" "Manly indeed!" said Nera. "By the truth of thy valour, take me on thy neck, that I may get a drink with thee. I was very thirsty when I was hanged." "Come on my neck then!" said Nera. So he went on his neck. "Whither shall I carry thee?" said Nera. "To the house which is nearest to us", said the captive.

5. So they went to that house. Then they saw something. A lake of fire round that house. `[round that hearth, H. 2. 16.]` "There is no drink for us in this house", said the captive. "There is no fire without sparing in it ever. "Let us therefore go to the other house, which is nearest to us", said the captive. They went to it then and saw a lake of water around it. "Do not go to that house!" said the captive. There is never a washing- nor a bathing-tub, nor a slop-pail in it at night after sleeping. "Let us still go to the other house", said the captive. "Now there is my drink in this house", said the captive. He let him down on the floor. He went into the house. There were tubs for washing and bathing in it, and a drink in either of them. Also a slop-pail on the floor of the house. He then drinks a draught of either of them and scatters the last sip from his lips at the faces of the people that were in the house, so that they ail died. Henceforth it is not good (to have) either a tub for washing or bathing, or a fire without sparing, or a slop-pail in a house after sleeping.

6. Thereupon he carried him back to his torture, and Nera returned to Cruachan. Then he saw something. The dun was burnt before him, and he beheld a heap of heads of their people (cut off) by the warriors from the dun. He went after the host then into the cave of Cruachan. "A man on the track here!" said the last man to Nera. "The heavier is the track", said his comrade `[the last man, Eg.]` to him, and each man said that word to his mate from the last man to the first man. Thereupon they reached the sid of Cruachan and went into it. Then the heads were displayed to the king in the sid. "What shall be done to the man that came with you?" said one of them. "Let him come hither, that I may speak with him", said the king. Then Nera came to them and the king said to him: "What brought thee with the warriors into the sid?" said the king to him. "I came in the company of thy host", said Nera. "Go now to yonder house", said the king. "There is a single woman there, who will make thee welcome. Tell her it is from me thou art sent to her, and come every day to this house with a burden of firewood".

7. Then he did as he was told. The woman bade him welcome and said: "Welcome to thee, if it is the king that sent thee hither". "It is he, truly", said Nera. Every day Nera used to go with a burden of firewood to the dun. He saw every day a blind man and a lame man on his neck coming out of the dun before him. They would go until they were at the brink of a well before the dun. "Is it there?" said the blind man. "It is indeed", said the lame one. "Let us go away", said the lame man. „

8. Nera then asked the woman about this. "Why do the blind and the lame man visit the well?" "They visit the crown, which is in the well", said the woman, "viz. a diadem of gold, which the king wears on his head. It is there it is kept". "Why do those two go?" said Nera. "Not hard to tell", said she, "because it is they that are trusted by the king to visit the crown. "One of them was blinded, the other lamed". "Come hither a little", said Nera to his wife, "that thou mayst tell me of my adventures now". "What has appeared to thee?" said the woman. "Not hard to tell", said Nera. "When I was going into the sid, methought the rath of Cruachan was destroyed and Ailill and Medb with their whole household had fallen in it". "That is not true indeed", said the woman, "but an elfin host came to thee. `[to them, H. 2. 16.]` That will come true", said she, unless he would reveal it to his friends. "How shall I give warning to my people?" said Nera. "Rise and go to them", said she. "They are still round the same caldron and the charge has not yet been removed from the fire." Yet it had seemed to him three days and three nights since he had been in the sid. "Tell them to be on their guard at Halloween coming, unless they come to destroy the side. For I will promise them this: the sid to be destroyed by Ailill and Medb, and the crown of Briun to be carried off by them".

9. [These are the three things, which were found in it, viz: the mantle of Loegaire in Armagh, and the crown of Briun in Connaught, and the shirt of Dunlaing in Leinster in Kildare.]

10. "How will it be believed of me, that I have gone into the sid?" said Nera. "Take fruits of summer with thee", said the woman. "Then he took wild garlic with him and primrose and golden fern. And I shall be pregnant by thee", said she "and shall bear thee a son. And send a message from thee to the sid, when thy people will come to destroy the sid, that thou mayest take thy family and thy cattle from the sid".

11. Thereupon Nera went to his people, and found them around the same caldron; and he related his adventures to them. And then his sword was given to him, and he staid with his people to the end of a year. That was the very vear, in which Fergus mac Roich came as an exile from the land of Ulster to Ailill and Medb to Cruachan. "Thy appointment has come, oh Nera", said Ailill to Nera. "Arise and bring thy people and thy cattle from the sid, that we may go to destroy the sid".

12. Then Nera went to his wife in the sid, and she bade him welcome. "Arise out to the dun now", said the woman to Nera, "and take a burden of firewood with thee. I have gone to it for a whole year with a burden of firewood on my neck every day in thy stead, and I said thou wert in sickness. And there is also thy son yonder". Then he went out to the dun, and carried a burden of firewood with him on his neck. "Welcome alive from the sickness in which thou wast!" said the king. "I am displeased that the woman should sleep with thee without asking". "Thy will shall be done about this", said Nera. "It will not be hard for thee", said the king. He went back to his house. "Now tend thy kine today!" said the woman. "I gave a cow of them to thy son at once after his birth". So Nera went with his cattle that day.

13. Then while he was asleep the Morrigan took the cow of his son, and the Donn of Cualgne bulled her in the east in Cualgne. She (the Morrigan) then went again westward with her cow. Cuchulaind overtook them in the plain of Murthemne as they passed across it. For it was one of Cuchulaind's *gessa* that even a woman should leave his land without his knowledge. [It was one of his gessa that birds should feed on lus land, unless they left something with him. It was one of his gessa that fish should be in the bays, unless they fell by him. It was one of his gessa that warriors of another tribe should be in his land without his challenging them, before morning, if they came at night, or before night, if they came in the day. Every maiden and every single woman that was in Ulster, they were in his ward till they were ordained for husbands. These are the gessa of Cuchulaind]. Cuchulaind overtook the Morrigan with her cow, and he said: "This cow must not be taken".

14. Nera went back then to his house with his kine in the evening. "The cow of my son is missing", said he. `[she, H. 2. 16.]` "I did not deserve that thou shouldst go and tend kine in that way", said his wife to him. On that came the cow. "A wonder now! Whence does this cow come?" "Truly, she comes from Cualgne, after being bulled by the Donn of Cualgne", said the woman. "Rise out now, lest thy warriors come", she said. "This host cannot go for a year till Halloween next. They will come on Halloween next: for the fairy-mounds of Erinn are always opened about Halloween".

15. Nera went to his people. "Whence comest thou?" said Ailill and Medb to Nera, "and where hast thou been since thou didst go from us?" "I was in fair lands", said Nera, "with great treasures and precious things, with plenty of garments and food, and of wonderful treasures. "They will come to slay you on Halloween coming, unless it had been revealed to you". "We shall certainly go against them", said Ailill. So they remain there till the end of the year. "Now if thou hast anything in the sid", said Ailill to Nera, "bring it away". So Nera went on the third day before Halloween and brought her drove out of the sid. Now as the bull calf went out of the sid, viz. the calf of the cow of Aingen (Aingene was the name of his son), it bellowed thrice. At that same hour Ailill and Fergus were playing drafts, when they heard something, the bellowing of the bull calf in the plain. Then said Fergus:

"I like not the calf  
bellowing in the plain of Cruachan,  
the son of the black bull of Cualgne, which approaches,  
the young son of the bull from Loch Laig.

There will be calves without cows  
on Bairche in Cualgne,  
the king will go a ... march  
through this calf of Aingene."

17. [Aingene was the name of the man and Be Aingeni the name of the woman, and the appearance which this Nera saw on them was the same as that which Cuchulaind saw in the Tain Bo Regamna.]

18. Then the bull calf and the Whitehorn `[of Ai, add. H. 2. 16.]` meet in the plain of Cruachan. A night and a day they were there fighting, until at last the bull calf was beaten. Then the bull calf bellowed when it was beaten. "What did the calf bellow?" Medb asked of her neat-herd, whose naim was Buaigle. "I know that, my good father Fergus", said Bricriu, "it is the strain which thou sangest in the morning". On that Fergus glanced aside and struck with his fist at Bricriu's head, so that the rive men of the draft-board that were in his hand, went into Bricriu's head, and it was a lasting hurt to him. "Tell me, o Buaigle, what did the bull say?" said Medb. "Truly, it said", answered Buaigle, "if its father came to fight with it, viz. the Donn of Cualgne, it would not be seen in Ai, and it would be beaten throughout the whole plain of Ai on every side". Then said Medb in the manner of an oath: "I swear by the gods that my people swear by, that I shall not lie down, nor sleep on down or flockbed, nor shall I drink butter-milk nor nurse my side, nor drink red ale nor white, nor shall I taste food, until I see those two kine fighting before my face".

19. Thereafter the men of Connaught and the black host of exile went into the sid, and destroyed the sid, and took out what there was in it. And then they brought away the crown of Briun. That is the third wonderful gift in Erinn, and the mantle of Loegaire in Armagh, and the shirt of Dunlaing in Leinster in Kildare. Nera was left with his people in the sid, and has not come out until now, nor will he come till Doom.

The Ulster Cycle. — The Tdin Bo Cualnge formed a kind of nucleus round which a number of other tales clustered. A Maher of these are called remscela or introductory stories to tk Tdin. Such are the "Revealing of the Tain," the "Debility of tk Ultonians," "The Cattle-Driving of Regamon, Dartaid and Flidais," Tdin bo Regamna , "The Cattle-Driving of Fraecb," "The Dispute of the Swine-herds," telling the previous history of the Bulls, "The Capture of the Fairy Mound," "The Dream of Oengus," the "Adventures of Nera," the "Wooing of Ferb," Other stories form a kind of continuation of the Tain.. Such are tk "Battle of Rosnaree," the "Great Rout of the Plain of Murtbemne" and "Cuchulinn’s Death." We are also told of the vengeance taken on the slayers by Conall Cemach. Other stories deal with the "Conception of Conchobar," the "Conception of Cuchulinn" "The Glories of Conchobar’s Reign," with an account of how k acquired the Throne from Fergus, "The Wooing of Emer and tk Hero’s Education in Scotland under Scathach," "The Siege of Howth," "Bricriu’s Feast and the Exile of the Sons of Dod Dermait," "The Battle of the Boyne" (Eriu, vol. ii.), "He Deaths of Ailill, Medb and Conall Cernach," "Destruction of Bruden Da Choca," "The Tragical Death of Conlaech at tk hands of Cuchulinn his father," "The Deaths of Goll and Gaibb, w "The Sickbed of Cuchulinn," "The Intoxication of the Ultonians," "The Death of Conchobar," "The Phantom Chariot of Cuclmlinn," in which the hero is brought up from the grave.

Four other stories in connection with the Ulster cycle remain to be mentioned. The first is Seel mucci Mate Datho ("Ik Story of MacDatho’s Pig"). In this savage but picturesque Irish story we find the Ulstermen vaunting their achievements against the Connaughtmen. Nowhere, perhaps, is the dramatic element better brought out. Apart from the Tdin the greatest and at the same time the longest saga in which Cuchulinn figures is Fled Brier end (Bricriu’s Feast). Bricriu is the mischief-maker among the Ulstermen, and he in turn incites the three chief heroes, Cuchulinn, Conall Cernach and Loigaire Buadach, to dak the champion’s portion in a feast which he prepared. In order to decide the dispute, visits are paid to Medb at Rath Cruato and to Curoi in Kerry, and the story ends with the "beheading incident," which occurs in the romance of "Sir Gawayne and tk Green Knight."

But the story of the Ulster cycle which is better known to any other, is the story of the "Tragical Death of the Sons of Usnech, or the Life and Death of Deirdre," one of the "Three Sorrows of Story-telling." This is almost the only tale of tk group which has survived in the minds of the common people down to the present day. It is foretold of Deirdre, a girl-ch® of great beauty, that she will be the cause of great misfortunes* but Conchobar, having lost his wife, determines to have her brought up in solitude and marry her himself. The oldest versioi of the story is found in LL., and the characters are as rugged m unsophisticated as those of the Tdin. But in the later version the savage features are toned down. '

Few of the old romances deal directly with what we may Irish mythology. The "Battle of Moytura" tells of the tp
