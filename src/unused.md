IV. THE STORY OF FIONN AND THE FEINNE. 

The rival Tribes of Baoisgne and Morna, and Cormac Mac Art, High King of Eireann :— their wars at home and abroad, their lives and their adventures. Told chiefly in the form of metrical Dialogues between Oisein, the last of the Pagan Heroea, and Padruig, tbe first of the Western Saints. From manuscripts and books which purport to contain matters orally collected in Scotland, or there written ; and from tbe recitations of men now living, in the Highlanda and Isles. Chronologically arranged under numbers and letters.

I. CUMHAL.

The Story of Cumhal, the father of Fionn, comeB neit in chronological order. I have made it up in English, from a great number of versions of the story told to me in the Highlands. A version is published in text Y. This is not recited as a composition, but told as history. The skeleton of the Story is shortly this : — Cumhal and his warriors, ' the Feinne,' went from Ireland to Scotland to drive out the Norsemen. They drove them out, and set up for themselves The Irish king and the Norse king conspired against the formidable rebel, enticed him to Ireland, marrìed him to a princess, and slew him in the arms of his wife. In the ballad of 1612, which I have placed A. 21., Fionn, and Garadh, one of the tribe of Morna, sit on a hill at a deer-pass, and Gaiadh there tells Fionn how and why tbe tribe of Morna slew his father. This slaying by the Clanna Morna ìs known in Ireland as ' the Battle of Cnucha.' The place is identified, and the event dated about a.d. 125. A second version of the Scotch ballad, got by Fletcher about 1760, is placed witb A. 21. becauae it seems best to fit in there. The Story of Fionn is put into tho mouth of Oisein, his son. His story comes next in order.

II. FIONN MAC CUMHAIL— Fint uao baoiscne.

I have placed together in Sec 12, Introduction, a great many Pedigrees of Fionn, orally collected ìn Scotland, and extracted from Irish manuscripts. The following, O., was got near Dunkeld, about a.d. 1800. With it is a compilation made from Irish authorities, by the Rev. John Francis Shearman of Howth, the Beinn Esdair of ballads, and close to the scene of the Battle of Clontarf. A pedigree from such a locality has peculiar valne, especially when compiled by a gentleman who is well known as an archaeologist.

III. OISEIN MAC FHINN. variodsly spelt.

The oldest known mention of Fionn ìs quoted page 293, Report on Ossian, 1806, from a manuscript which Dr. Donald Smith then supposed to date from the latter end of the 8th century. Irish manuscripts of the 12th century, later authorities, the ballada which follow, and traditions current where Gaelic is spoken, tell the same story in fragments. Fionn and the Feinne were the successors of Cumhal and Cuchullin, and the soldiers of Cormac Mac Art, High King of Ireland (213. 253.) The Gaelic speaking people amongst whom I was raised, and amongst whom I have been at work during the laat twelve years at odd times, tell a story which can be traced from 900 to 1872. I have never discovercd a trace of the story or history which is told ìn Mac Pherson's Ossian.

There is hardly a trace of his Gaelic even in coIIections made shortly before, and sixty-five years after the publication of Ossian in Gaelic. Thera is no mention of Fingal, King of Morven, in any known writing older than 1760. But the stories which I have ranged in order from I. to IV. about Cuchullin, Deirdre, Fraoch, Cumhal, Fionn, and Oisein, are so mingled and so woven with Mac Pheraon's English works, that all Gaelic Scotland recognised familiar names and ìncidents. The=y unanimoualy condemned traditions as spurious and corrupt, and believed Mac Phersbon's Ossian to be a translation from some excellent old Caledonian manuscript. I now believe that Mac Pherson's Ossian is a great original work of fiction, dating trom 1760, when it appeared in print ; and that the Gaelic of 1807 is one of many tranalations. The Gaelic ballads tell Romantic, Metrical, Popular, Scoto-Irish hiatory about the ' authenticity ' of which there can be no controversy. The outline of the story which ìs put into tbe mouth of Oisein, the son ot Fionn, ìs shortly this: —

AFTER the general Irish war of the Tain bo Cuailgne, in which Cuchullin of Dundalk nas the chief hero, in the time of Conn of the Hundred Fights, from whom many Scotch tribes claim descent, the army quarrelled. The tribe of Morna slew Cumhal, the chief of the tribe of Baoiscne (variously spelt). Scandinavians were concerned in the slaying, and they took possession in Ireland. Cumhal's posthumous son, Fionn, was saved, grew up, aud fled to the wilds. Art, son of Conn, High King of Ireland, was slain ; and his posthumous illegitimate son Connac grow up in obscurity. After many adventures, Fionn Mac Cumhail returaed, gathered his scattered tribe, and made peace witb the riva! tribe of Morna. Cormac appeared, fought the usurpers, recovered Conn's seat as High King at Teamhra. Fionn commanded tha Feinne at Almhuin, which now is the Hill of Allen, near Tara. They expelled the usurping Danes, and guarded the Irish coast. Like all popular heroes, Fionn had mythical properties, of which the chiof was ' Bran,' a hound, who, in some strange fashion, was his near relative. The Northern Sea rovers continued to persecute Fionn, and demand Bran, till they were conquered. All sorts of people from Spain, Sorcha, Italy, Greece, Britain, and elsewhere attacked the Feinne, and were defeated; all sorts of mythical magical people schemed their destruction, but in vain. They made raids in all directions, upon Italy and Greece, and Lochlan and Britain, and conquered everybody everywhere.

People from distant lands joined them, and served as Feinne. At last they quarrelled. Caoilte had to rescue Fionn from the King, and Cormac slips out of the story. Fionn is called ' King of Teamhra ' sometimes, and the story probably was that he dethroned Cormac. Then the blood-feud between Fionn and Goll broke out. Goll slew Fionn's son, and the tribe of Baoiscne slew him. Then jealousy broke out. Diarmaid, Fionn;s twin sister's son, ran away with his uncle's bride, Graidhne, Comiac's daughter. The tribe pursued, and quarrelled and fought, to the joy of Conan. Diarmaid was slain at last by the wiles of Fionn. Next, Oscar, the son of Oisein, the son of Fionn, the son of Cumhal, quarrelled with Cairbre, the son of Cormac, the son of Art, the son of Conn of the Hundred Fights. They fell out at a feast at Teamhra, now Tara, and fought the battlc of Gabhra, not far from Dublin. There Oscar and Cairbre slew each other, and Fionn arrived from the sea in time to see his grandson die, and carry him to Almhuin, tha Hìll of Allen. Long afterwards, Oisein, who had been enchanted by his mother, who lived in the shape of a deer, came back from the Isle of Youth at an impossible age, and told the story to St. Patrick. The old Pagan is made to complain of jangling bells and howling clerics, to sit upon the Fenians Mound — that is, upon the Hill of Allen — and point to the graves of his comrades, and tell their story to the priest, who wrote it down. In this form of dialogue between Reciter and Scribe, Pagan and Christian, blind old ballad-singing warrior and audience, this Story is told over winter fires, in fragments which are now crumbling fast. In this very form the story was told in fragments to Dean Mac GrEGor, in 1512- 26. I have done nothing to these. I have simply gathered them and sorted them. Samples of the Gaelic poems which tell the tale in metre follow, with references to the manuscripts from which they were copied. The prose tales which I have gathered I will place when I translate.

The Heroes of Ballads seem all to have been rèlated. ' Iodhlan ' was ' Camhals ' brother. Goll, Conan, and Garaidh wore chiefs of the Clanna Morna. Fionn, Oìsein hìs son, Oscar his grandson. Diarmaid his nephew, Faolan, Feargus, Roidhne, and Caireall, his younger ones, Caoilte, his relative, make eloven chief characters who fìgure in the Ballads which follow. The Pedigrees speak for themselves.

H. THE INTRODUCTION TO KENNEDY'S FIRST COLLECTION. 1774.

Advocates' Library, November 24, 1871. Copied by Malcobn Macphail.

This Introduction is a sample of a dialect of English *that never has been prìnted. It is the English spoken by men whose native language is Gaelic, but Kennedy's Manuscrìpt is the only wrìtten sample of the perìod that I have ever seen. The beginning is tom off. The word 'Fingal ' does not once occur in Kennedy's Gaelic.

J. F. C.


... this son of Comhal was afraid that his own wife would do some mischief to this son, and for that reason he ordered the midwife to take him away. She went with him unto the wood and she got a wright and made a hole in the Trunk of a large oak tree, in the same manner as a Canoe would be made, and door to it, so that nobody would find her, and she nourished him their by fat and marrow, when he was coming to age, she was learaing him how to fight and wrestle, when she would get the better of him, she would heartily beat him, when he came to the age of eighteen years or there about, he was going out of the woods and one day boys met him Shinnying, the play pleased him, he went ard got a rung and began with them, he was seeing that the boys was afraid of him, he would take the ball from them all ; since he gained on them he began to beat them with the Shinney, and left  them half dead, others he broke their hand or feet (according to his nurse's regulation, for he thought that they had the same,) when the men have seen their children abused by such a person, they call'd after him saying who is this fellow that is Fionn-é that have done this harm to our sons, his nurse heard them, and she said let bruke his name Fingal the son of Comhal, this is the way Pedigree. that he was baptized ; for Fionn-Gheal is a Galic word, its signification is fair and white. ...

...

to himself ; he was mnning away from his pursuer, and his nurse was turning weary, he took her and put her over his shoulder and was running through thorns and brìers, rocks and stony places, when he stop in the middle of the wood his nurse was dead on his back, and her head dashed against rocks with the jumping ; in such a manner that one half of her was lost, and he cast the other half in a water loch in the same wood called Lochluirgin, He was then alone in the wood, and nobody with him, he did not know where his father was, but that he heard his nurse saying that his father's name was Comhal. He met a man at a place called Eas-ruaidh one day and a salmon in his hand, he said into Fingal if thou wilt roast this fish without burning a spot of his skin, I will tell you where your father is, Fingal began the fish, but there was some spots bumed on the fish, and he was refusing to tell him anything about his f ather, then Fingal took hold of him and laid him down, the man was then obliged to tell him where his father was. Fingal went to his father to the army, and this is Fingal's descent, and that he was nourished according as we are told by the oldest men who are in the country at the present time.

The King of Denmark heard in his own kingdom that, it was said by some prophecies, ... named Fingal that would conquer Ireland to himself, sometimes afterwards he heard that Fingal was in the army among the Heroes ; and he ordered a great reward to be given to any one of his own men that would kill Fingal, and take his head to him. Sometimes after that Comhal's poet happened to meet the King of Denmark's poet, and they began to drink; before they departed Denmark's poet told to Comhal's poet that there was a remarkable person in their army named Fingal, and that their King had offered a great reward for his head. Immediately this was told to Comhal by his Bard, then Comhal sends his son Fingal to his mother and her friends named Chlanna Morna, who inhabited all the westem coast of Scotland then, a very famous set of people who was remarkable, in strength and bigness, and accordingly good warrìors, to take care of him, and to leam him the art of war and himting, which was their chief education at that time.

When Comhal died the heroes heard of Fingal's fame, likewise his wisdom and bravery, and that he would get a compleat victory over any enemy, they send for him to Scotland to be their King. Fingal succeeded his father, and continued in war against Denmark, till he had almost conquered Ireland ; for they fought several battles, and Fingal would always gain the victory. Then the King thought that he would get a wife from the heroes. She would tell them how they might conquer Fingal. Then the King send to Fingal for to ask of him, if he pleased that they would make peace, and that he would take one of their virgins to be his wife. Then Fingal imderstood his design, he ordered the King for to come to visit him, and that he would get his choice of their women in marrìage, and that he would appoint a day for to make a feast, which they settled, and before the appointed day came Fingal ordered his snàth to make a set of good knives, then the smith asked of him how he would make them, and Fingal directed him as it is set down in the following verse : —

> "If a blacksmith I wou'd be,  
> How fine wou'd I make knives for fee ;  
> With thick iron backs edg'd thin with steel,  
> And yellow shafts smoothly you'd see.'

Those knives are called by us Durks, and Fingal was the first contrìver of them.

The day of the feast came, and there was joy and mirth within their sounding Halls ; there was conditions of peace thought to be betwixt them, but it happened before the feast was over that their foul deeds appeared. Fingal gave to every one of his companions a durk (called by them a hiding knife), and he ordered them, at the hindmost end of the feast, when he would give them notice to make with their new made arms venison for the Gr .... Denmark's valiant men. Then the King of Denmark came with his men to Fingal's house with gr ... who was saluted very generously by them.

Then when dinner was prepared for them, and when it was ready, both were called. Fingal placed the King's men and his own, man by man according to his rank, and the music of bards was heard in their presence, when dinner was ended, Fingal stabbed his own durk in a piece of beef on the table. Immediately every one of his men stabed the King's men, and there was none left but tho King himself, who was made prisoner. The King of Denmark then promised to Fingal the one fourth part of Ireland to himseif now and for ever, and a great reward for to defend the rest from any other brutal force, if he would not trouble him any more (unless it would be his own fault), and to iet him at liberty, which Fingal promised to do (and performed all his days), for the reward ; since Fingal was called the King of Innis' fail, a county in Ireland, called now Leinster.

When Fingal had settled in Ireland, and had peaoe, he was coming twice a year to Scotland to visit his mother's friends, Chlanna Morna (the Heroes of Scotiand) and to hunting, then Goll their King and Fingal joined together and made one company, and their chief command was given to Fingal, then he had the chief command of all the wester cost of Scotland and Ireland. Then he fortifìod places fìt for building, and settled the people which he had under his command, nor was he less assisted in that matter by good conduct than by good fortune, for he was invested among thcm with regal authority with kingdoms. [Fingal's wisdom and bravery triumphed over brutal force ; or another nobler still, that the most compleat victory over an enemy is obtained by that moderation and generosity which convert him to a friend. Here, indeed, in the character and description of Fingal, Ossian triumphs almost unrivalled ; for we may boldly defy all antiquity to show us any Hero equal to Fingal. Throughout the whole of Ossian's works, he is presented to us in all the variety of lights which give the full display of a charactcr. In him occur almost all the qualities that can ennoble human nature, that can either make us admire the hero or love the man. He was not only unconquerable in war, but he made his people happy by his wisdom in the days of peace. He was truly the father of his people, and distinguished on every occasion by humanity and generosity. He was merciful to his foes, ful of affection to his children, full of concern about his friends; he was surrounded with his family, and he instructs them all in the principles of virtue peculiar to that age. He was universal protector of the distressed, whether they would be guilty or guiltless ; none of such ever went sad from Fingal ; as it may be observed by the following advice to his grandson Oscar : —

> 'Oscar, bend the strong in arms,  
> But spare the feeblo hand ;  
> Be thou a stream of many tides  
> Against thy foes in war,  
> But like the gale that moves the grass  
> To those who ask thino aid.'

Fingal says likewise, 'My arm was the support of the injured ; the weak rested behind the lightning of my steel.' Thesewere the maxims of true heroism, to which he formed his grandson. Fingal's fame was represented as everywhere spread, the greatest Heroes acknowledged his superiority, his enemies trembled at his name, and the highest encomium tliat can be bestowed on one wbom the poet would most exalt, is to say, 'That his soul was like the soul of Fingal.']

TO DO FROM HERE

Fingal and his heroes combined in strength, wealth, and n>|mtation till decripit old age was coming upon them, tlion they were decreasing daily. Fingal in his latter days had his dwelling-placo in the Isle of Sky (which was called at that time the Isle of Mist), and the house was built on a hill above the place where Mac Kinivin's old castle licB, the north-west side of Caol reth, and they wcre still hunting through Sky since it was the best place for hunting at that tinie, for vanis«»n was very scarce then for a while in both Scotland and Ireland, and they begun to tiU the top of the mountains where it was bare without wood to support them ; then the Heroes became lean and i)oor, but the women were not so, thoy wondered how comely and fair the wonien looked besides themselves. The women were always making their drink of the dccoction of Southeni wood, raspberries, and the like, and supposed that drink was the reason of their complexion being so fair, and besides thoy were keeping the f)C8t pieces of the venison and dressing it for themselves unknown to the Heroes when they would be absent. One day they went to the continent opi>o8Ìte to them to hunf, and they left Garbh unknown to their women in the house for to see what entertainments they would have, bcsides themselves. Garbh was in his bed after the



rest went off for to watch the women, he fell into a deep sleep, and snored, the women heard him and immedÌiately camo to him, and tied his hair on both sides of his heiidy and wove it again into three plaits, and fastened it to wooden pins, and put it in the ground ; they went ont of the house, then every one of them cried, * Huza, huMM^ huza,' wìth a loud voice, then Garbh wakened suddenly out of his sleep (for he thought that the enemy waa at hand) and left all his hair of his head with the Bkin to the pins, and came out in that pitiful condition, and Bome of the women were laughing at him. Wben he had seen how he was with their contrivance, and how heartily they were laughing at his calamity, he went immediately to the wood, pulled trees out of their roott and made faggots of them, and brought them home with all speed. VVheu he came he found the women in the hoiue, he locked them in and put a faggot burning in every conieE of the house till he set it on fire and all the women within it. Afterwards Garbh ran away into a cave to hide himself from the Heroes ; Fingal had seen the houae on fire, he called all his men together, and they ran in hope that they would quench it, and jumped over the smidl Soand (that is betwixt Sky and the Und) on their shiolda (acoept one of them who was cilled Mac Reth, he was dròwned there, and they callod that sound Caolreth since thai day). When the house could not be quenched but destroved with the fìre, and all their women, children, and furniture ruined, they searched all places about for Garbh (when Fingal told them by soutlisaying who was the destroyer), and found him in a cave, they conjured him to come out, and examined him about the matter, he told them the truth how all things happened. Then Fingal condemned him to be put to death. Garhh asked a petition of Fingal before he would be baniahed, that was granted him (for Fingal nevor refused a petition to any person, and particularly the distressed). Garbh's petition was that he would be beheaded on Fingal's thigh by Fingal's own sword, by the hand of Oacar (the strongest man), then they were all afraid that Finsal would loose his leg, theu they thought proper to let Garbh away than to kill him uiK>n Fingal's thigh ; then some of them ordered Fingars thigh to be buried seven feet deep in the earth, and to laid lùs head above Fingal's thigh upon the earth (since it would not break Fingal's promise) then Oscar cut his head off, and with the force of the struke Fingal's leg was cut above the knee. Then he went to Rome with his attendance for to cure his leg, and left Oscar in his stead. Before he came home the battle of Cathcabhara was fought between Oscar and Cairdaidh, the King of Ireland. Oscar and almost all his men were slain ; a few days after the battle was fought Fingal came home and found a few number of his famous champions alive lamenting Oscar ; and we hear no more of their deeds afterwards.

After so particular examination of Fingal, I procced to make some observations on Ossian.

Ossiau lived after them all in Ireland, in the house of his daughter, who was married to Peter Mac Alpin, a man that came from Ilome to instruct them in the principles of Keligion there. It was that man that waa writing all histories and poenis of the Heroes which Ossian told him in his latter days, but never published till this age, when there is but few fragments of them to be got. The following is collectcd from the oldest men, who lives at present in this wcster side of Scotland.

[Here follows a mauifest quotation.]

Ossian had all the art and skill of pure poetry. He had the spirit, the fire, the inspiration of a poet.

He utter the voice of nature, he elevates by his sentiments. He interests by his description. He paint the heart as well as tlie fancy. He makes his readers glnw and tremble and weep. These are the great characteristics of pure poetry. He breath nothing of cheerfulness as he expresseth himself.

How sorrowful is this old ago to me, thinking on the warrior*s famoiis deeds. Like an oak tree in desert most cold after my sheltered neiglibour*s laid down low.

Tliis is a melancholy verse of Ossian, in which he compares himself to an ancient oak mouldering alone in his place, that the terriblo blasts of Eolus with her cold Dreezes hath laid down the rest and looped his branches away.

His continual grief was of thinking that he was left alone to suffer intìrmities and sorrow after all the Heroes among whom he liourished. Other tinies he would theer himseìf thinking on their past wars, loves, and friendships. He was not like modern bards, he did not sung for to please readers and critics, for to gain food or raiment, but for to spread their fanie, reputation, and generosity thro' the world, and to reveal his love to them. I do not pretend to say any more of him, for I think it too tedions, but let the reader observe the following versifìcation : —

and they had seen no beasts for sport but wild Boar, which wae of great bulk and height in proportion. They loosed sixteen Thraves of their Dogs in order to kill him, and pursued him till they overtook him, and theu he slew them all upon the spot. Then Fingal offered his choice of their women with many precious gifts, to any man who would kill the Boar. CaoUte, the son of Ronan
grho was called Terror of Battle), undertook to kill him. e chased him through woods, mountains, valley s, plains and smooth shores ; he at last caught him, but could not kill him, for the Poem says he could jew his arms as green Ru&hes or Reed : Then he called a familiar spirit who was in love witb Him, and directed and assisted him till he got the Diabolioal beast kill. He went then home, and was generously rewarded and got everything they had promised him.

Then they departed, and Caoilte retumed to the Heroes with the Boar's head ; when Fingal saw that he had it, he was vexed that he promised him his choice of their women, for he was sure that Caoilte would choose his own wife. Then he thought proper to cover all their heads, and to put them out one by one, and to let him take his choice thus, (since it would not break his pro- nìise). They put out Fingal's wìfe first, in hopes that Caoilte would stop until a good number of them would come out ; but Caoilte took the fìrst according to his familiar love's advice

The Heroes were hunting on a mountain called White Mountain ; the day being fair and the air favourable ; but before the night came great mist overshadowed all the Hills and valleys below, so that the darkness separated the oue from the other. They use to bind Caoilte's knees, because he was so swift in mnning, that none of them could not be up with him, so that he would wjdk slowly, but they forgot to bind him that day, and when he went astray once, he made a great way through hiUs, rocks, mountains, and unknown valleys, and about the Twilight he saw a Hermitage far off in a Glen ; he ran towards it, went in, and there was none in it, but a young dame, he was trembUng with fear, for it was glittering with arms, but she invited and conforted him, and made him sit down, and was verj' kindly entertained and lay with her during the night, and told him tliat she was a King's Daughter, and that a Giant stoFd her away, and that she inchanted him not to touch her as a ^-ife for a year and a day, the said time was expired when Caoilte came ; she awakeued him very early, and said that the Genie was coming from of shore and that it was better for him to die than to go to fight with hini.

60 Unes.
Kennedy, 1st Collection, page 66. Advocates' Library.
December 9, 1871. Copied by Malcolm Macphail. Note. — ^December 17, 1871, Dublin. Not known to Hen-
nessy in Irish manuscripts ; not known to me orally
preserved. — J. F. C

A MUSiciAN came to the Heroes, whom they called Claigean Mac Choin a chinn chruaidh, (that is, Hard Head or Hard Scul,) to sing a timbrel to them ; and he would play so hard and loud that none of them could stay to hear it. Caoilte was watching ; he came where he was and asked of him, how many Heroes had Fingal ; he told him that they were dÌTÌded into seven Cathaims, (that is, into sevcn Regiments or Companies, but it is not known how many were in each, but supposed to be 500,) and that every one had a wife, a servant-man, and two dogs ; he went then to the house and played on the Timbrel. Since they coidd not stay to hear it, Fingal excused him- self, saying that their women were . . . sorrowful, and that they do not like any music at present ; but he would not give over playing unless he would get his own dog, named Bran, his two spears, and his sword ; but Fing^ refused that, sa^òng that his music was not pleasant, and that he would not get his request, since he do not deserve it ; then hc gave three sounds, and the Heroes were deaf a long while afterward. They sent all their dogs after him, but in vain till they loosed Bran, who overtook him at a cave in Beinn Eùdain, and kiUed him. Though the Heroes did not ever get victory by human strength over any sort of evil spirits, sorcerers, and the like ; yet Fingal was inchanted and happy among mortals, so that he would get the better of any sort of spirits, conspirators, inchauters, aud brutal force.
