# Meet the Heroes

The tale I tend to refer to as *The Cottage, the cat and the goat* (based on the variant I first heard), but which is perhaps better known as *How Dermot Got His Love-Spot*, as described elsewhere, provides a great frame for describing some of the characteristics of several of the Fenian heroes.

But before meet that tale in the next chapter, let's introduce some of the heroes, starting with various accounts given by Thomas Rolleston in the chapter XI, "*Finn's Chief Men*" of [*The High Deeds Of Finn*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.178478/page/n131/mode/2up), published in 1910.

## Conán mac Lia

Let us start with the lesser known of the two Conans who feature in several of the tales.

In *CHAPTER XI: Finn's Chief Men*, of [*The High Deeds Of Finn*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.178478/page/n131/mode/2up), T. W. Rolleston, 1910, pp120-128.

WITH the coming of Finn did the Fianna of Erinn come to their glory, and with his life their glory passed away. For he ruled them as no other captain ever did, both strongly and wisely, and never bore a grudge against any, but freely forgave a man all offences save disloyalty to his lord. Thus it is told that Conan, son of the Lord of Luachar, him who had the Treasure Bag and whom Finn slew at Rath Luachar, was for seven years an outlaw and marauder, harrying the Fians, and killing here a man and there a hound, and firing their dwellings, and raiding their cattle. At last they ran him to a corner at Cam Lewy in Munster, and when he saw that he could escape no more he stole upon Finn as he sat down after a chase, and flung his arms round him from behind, holding him fast and motionless. Finn knew who held him thus and said, "What wilt thou Conan?" Conan said, "To make a covenant of service and fealty with thee, for I may no longer evade thy wrath." So Finn laughed and said, "Be it so, Conan, and if thou prove faithful and valiant, I also will keep faith." And Conan served him for thirty years, and no man of all the Fianna was keener and hardier in fight.

## Conan mac Morna

The other Conan is the fool of the Fianna, he of the hairy back and the baldest of heads, who could brag but not deliver...

In *CHAPTER XI: Finn's Chief Men*, of [*The High Deeds Of Finn*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.178478/page/n131/mode/2up), T. W. Rolleston, 1910, pp120-128.

There was also another Conan, namely, mac Morna, who was big and bald, and unwieldy in manly exercises, but whose tongue was bitter and scurrilous; no high or brave thing was done that Conan the Bald did not mock and belittle. It is said that when he was stripped he showed down his back and buttocks a black sheep's fleece instead of a man's skin, and this is the way it came about. One day when Conan and certain others of the Fianna were hunting in the forest they came to a stately Dún, whitewalled, with coloured thatching on the roof, and they entered it to seek hospitality. But when they were within they found no man, but a great empty hall with pillars of cedar wood and silken hangings about it, like the hall of a wealthy lord. In the midst there was a table set forth with a sumptuous feast of boar's flesh and venison, and a great vat of yew wood full of red wine, and cups of gold and silver. So they set themselves gaily to eat and drink, for they were hungry from the chase, and talk and laughter were loud around the board. But one of them ere long started to his feet with a cry of fear and wonder, and they all looked round, and saw before their eyes the tapestried walls changing to rough wooden balks and the ceiling to foul sooty thatch like that of a herdsman's hut. So they knew they were being entrapped by some enchantment of the Fairy Folk, and all sprang to their feet and made for the doorway, that was no longer high and stately but was shrinking to the size of a fox earth, — all but Conan the Bald, who was gluttonously devouring the good things on the table, and heeded nothing else. Then they shouted to him, and as the last of them went out he strove to rise and follow, but found himself limed to the chair so that he could not stir. So two of the Fianna, seeing his plight, rushed back and seized his arms and tugged with all their might, and if they dragged him away, they left the most part of his raiment and his skin sticking to the chair. Then, not knowing what else to do with him in his sore plight, they clapped upon his back the nearest thing they could find, which was the skin of a black sheep that they took from a peasant's flock hard by, and it grew there, and Conan wore it till his death.

Though Conan was a coward and rarely adventured himself in battle with the Fianna, it is told that once a good man fell by his hand. This was on the day of the great battle with the pirate horde on the Hill of Slaughter in Kerry. `[The hill still bears the name, Knockanar.]` For Liagan, one of the invaders, stood out before the hosts and challenged the bravest of the Fians to single combat, and the Fians, in mockery, thrust Conan forth to the fight. When he appeared, Liagan laughed, for he had more strength than wit, and he said, "Silly is thy visit, thou bald old man." And as Conan still approached, Liagan lifted his hand fiercely, and Conan said, "Truly thou art in more peril from the man behind than from the man in front." Liagan looked round; and in that instant Conan swept off his head and then threw down his sword and ran for shelter to the ranks of the laughing Fians. But Finn was very wroth because he had won the victory by a trick.

## Dermot

Dermot, about whom the saga of his romance with Grainne forms another, significant, tale, is briefly characterised:

```{admonition} Dermot of the Love-Spot
:class: dropdown

In *CHAPTER XI: Finn's Chief Men*, of [*The High Deeds Of Finn*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.178478/page/n131/mode/2up), T. W. Rolleston, 1910, pp120-128.


And one of the chiefest of the friends of Finn was Dermot of the Love Spot. He was so fair and noble to look on that no woman could refuse him love, and it was said that he never knew weariness, but his step was as light at the end of the longest day of battle or the chase as it was at the beginning. Between him and Finn there was great love, until the day when Finn, then an old man, was to wed Grania, daughter of Cormac the High King; but Grania bound Dermot by the sacred ordinances of the Fian chivalry to fly with her on her wedding night, which thing, sorely against his will, he did, and thereby got his death. But Grania went back to Finn, and when the Fianna saw her they laughed through all the camp in bitter mockery, for they would not have given one of the dead man's fingers for twenty such as Grania.

CHAPTER X

HOW DIARMID CAME TO FINN

A SCORE of young warriors burst from the wide doors of Mongfinn's house and ran joyfully across the lawm. Their polished shields leaped upon their backs as they ran. It was May morning. It had rained during the night, but the sun now shone brightly and the wet fields and trees glistened in his rays. The youths were Mongfinn's finished scholars. They came fresh from her hands, each of them with her kiss and her blessing on his head. Whither did they run so swiftly and with such joyful cries and exclamations? To the Hill of Allen, to Finn, to be entered in the roll of his men, in case they should pass the examination; and all felt sure that they would pass.

Leaving the lawn they struck a narrow path in the woods and ran on, one by one, making pleasant echoes in the still forest. When they emerged from the forest they came to a rocky ravine through which a torrent rushed. There were stepping-stones in the torrent, but they were now hidden, for the torrent was greatly swollen; a brown swirling mass of rough water rushed down the ravine.

Nothing daunted, the foremost of the party ran to the torrent, holding his two spears in front of him with the hafts forward, as boys now use leaping poles. He planted these on the edge of the torrent, and springing upwards, rose between them and propelled himself clear across the water. The rest did the same, only the youngest of the party fell back once, not having sprung with sufficient force, but encouraged by the rest he succeeded at the second attempt.

As they were proceeding on their journey they heard a groan, and looking back, saw an aged woman leaning on a staff on the far side of the torrent, a little out of the way. She said, "You who are so young, strong, and happy, have pity on one who is old, weak, and sorrowful, for I cannot cross this wild torrent without aid."

"We cannot," they answered; "we are bound for the court of the most splendid captain on earth, and we must not appear in his presence in raiment soiled and dripping. Some strong churl will soon pass this way and take thee over the torrent."

So they went on their way, but not all. One of them, a tall and very beautiful stripling, stayed behind. His name was Diarmid. A second time he bounded lightly over the torrent, and having saluted the old woman respectfully, he raised her in his young strong arms and bore her through the ford. The torrent reached to his shoulders and was so violent that no ordinary man could have resisted it. Yet he reached the other side safely, and set her down carefully. As he was about to run forward again, he was aware of a tall, stately, and beautiful woman who stood by his side equipped like a warrior, her countenance so bright that it dazzled him to look upon it. Beside her stood a tall man, as glorious as the woman, but not armed. He smiled on the lad. "I know thee, O Angus," said the youth.

"Wherefore hast thou played this trick upon me?" "To prove thy chivalry," he answered. Then the man and the woman wrapped themselves in their magic mantle of woven air and were no more seen.

Diarmid pursued his party and came up with them as they were entering the camp.

When they came before Finn all the rest looked bright and clean and pleasant to the eye, but Diarmid"s scarlet mantle, all but a little of it, was stained brown with the muddy water, and his white tunic with gold buttons was also defiled, and he looked like a spot in the midst of his comrades. When Finn saw him he said sternly, "Thou hast been wading in torrents to-day."

"I have," said Diarmid.

"Why did you not leap them like your comrades," said Finn.

"That I cannot tell," answered the young man, with a blush.

Then Finn looked fixedly at him and said, "I can. I see thee crossing a swollen torrent with an aged woman in thy arms. And thou hast seen a glorious sight. It is still shining in thy face and in thy eyes. Thou shalt have success in war and success in love. All things good and nothing bad shall ever be told concerning thee at all time, and thy glory will last till the end of the world."

The woman whom Diarmid met at the torrent was the war-goddess of the Gael: the man was Angus Ogue, son of the Dagda, the god of youth and beauty, from the fairy Brugh on the Boyne.

I lingered on the royal Brugh which stands By the dark-rolling waters of the Boyne Where Angus Ogue magnificently dwells.

## Cuilthé

Variously spelled, Cuilthe (Keelta, Caoilte, Cailte) was the fastest of the Fianna, who also found fame in some tellings as one of the too long-lived Fianna (along with Oísin), who was to pass the tals of the Fianna on to St Patrick.

```{admonition} Rolleston on Keelta mac Ronan, Oisín, and Oscar
:class: dropdown

In *CHAPTER XI: Finn's Chief Men*, of [*The High Deeds Of Finn*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.178478/page/n131/mode/2up), T. W. Rolleston, 1910, pp120-128.

Others of the chief men that Finn had were Keelta mac Ronan, who was one of his house-stewards and a strong warrior as well as a golden-tongued reciter of tales and poems. And there was Oisin, the son of Finn, the greatest poet of the Gael, of whom more shall be told hereafter. And Oisín had a son Oscar, who was the fiercest fighter in battle among all the Fians. He slew in his maiden battle three kings, and in his fury he also slew by mischance his own friend and condisciple Linne. His wife was the fair Aideen, who died of grief after Oscar's death in the battle of Gowra, and Oisin buried her on Ben Edar (Howth), and raised over her the great cromlech which is there to this day.

...

It was said that one of the Fians, namely Keelta, lived on to a great age, and saw St Patrick, by whom he was baptized into the faith of the Christ, and to whom he told many tales of Finn and his men, which Patrick's scribe wrote down. And once Patrick asked him how it was that the Fianna became so mighty and so glorious that all Ireland sang of their deeds, as Ireland has done ever since. Keelta answered, "Truth was in our hearts and strength in our arms, and what we said, that we fulfilled."

This was also told of Keelta after he had seen St Patrick and received the Faith. He chanced to be one day by Leyney in Connacht, where the Fairy Folk of the Mound of Duma were wont to be sorely harassed and spoiled every year by pirates from_ oversea. They called Keelta to their aid, and by his counsel and valour the invaders were over-come and driven home, but Keelta was sorely wounded. Then Keelta asked that Owen the seer of the Fairy Folk might foretell him how long he had to live, for he was already a very aged man. Owen said, "It will be seventeen years, O Keelta of fair fame, till thou fall by the pool of Tara, and grievous that will be to all the King's household." "Even so did my chief and lord, my guardian and loving protector, Finn, foretell to me," said Keelta "And now what fee will ye give me for my rescue of you from the worst affliction that ever befell you?" "A great reward," said the Fairy Folk, "even youth; for by our art we shall change you into a young man again with all the strength and activity of your prime." "Nay, God forbid," said Keelta, "that I should take upon me a shape of sorcery, or any other than that which my Maker, the true and glorious God, hath bestowed upon me." And the Fairy Folk said, "It is the word of a true warrior and hero, and the thing that thou sayest is good." So they healed his wounds, and every bodily evil that he had, and he wished them blessing and victory, and went his way.

I forget where I first heard the following tale, which describes just how swiftly Cuilthe was said to be able to run, but I love it for the comic potential.

There was a king in Ireland long ago, and he wished to have the sand from each shore brought to him every morning — from north, south, east and west. He would know by examining the sand if any foe had landed in the country during the night. Three men applied for the job as his messenger. "How long would it take for you to collect the sands?" said the king to the first man. "While the leaf is falling from a tree!" said the man. 'Oh, would you not be fast enough,' said the king. The second man said he would collect the sands as fast as a cat slipping between two houses. 'Not fast enough',' said the king. The third man was Caoilte. 'How long would it take you?' the king asked. 'As long as it takes a woman to change her mind!' said Caoilte. 'Did you set out yet?' asked the king. 'I returned just now', said Caoilte.

In the tale of Fionn's wooing of Grainne, we also hear of Caoilte's great speed as he rounds up pairs of all the animals in Ireland on Fionn's behalf.

## mac Luga

Geena, son of Luga, more commonly referred to as mac Luga, is describd by Rollston by way of a tale in which Fionn gives him some advice.

```{admonition} mac Luga (Geena, son of Luga)
:class: dropdown

In *CHAPTER XI: Finn's Chief Men*, of [*The High Deeds Of Finn*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.178478/page/n131/mode/2up), T. W. Rolleston, 1910, pp120-128.

Another good man that Finn had was Geena, the son of Luga; his mother was the warrior-daughter of Finn, and his father was a near kinsman of hers. He was nurtured by a woman that bore the name of Fair Mane, who had brought up many of the Fianna to manhood. When his time to take arms was come he stood before Finn and made his covenant of fealty, and Finn gave him the captaincy of a band. But mac Luga proved slothful and selfish, for ever vaunting himself and his weapon-skill and never training his men to the chase of deer or boar, and he used to beat his hounds and his serving-men. At last the Fians under him came with their whole company to Finn at Loch Lena in Killarney, and there they laid their complaint against mac Luga, and said, "Choose now, O Finn, whether you will have us, or the son of Luga by himself."

Then Finn sent to mac Luga and questioned him, but mac Luga could say nothing to the point as to why the Fianna would none of him. Then Finn taught him the things befitting a youth of noble birth and a captain of men, and they were these:—

"Son of Luga, if armed service be thy design, in a great man's household be quiet, be surly in the narrow pass.

"Without a fault of his beat not thy hound; until thou ascertain her guilt, bring not a charge against thy wife.

"In battle, meddle not with a buffoon, for, O mac Luga, he is but a fool.

"Censure not any if he be of grave repute; stand not up to take part in a brawl; have nought to do with a madman or a wicked one.

"Two-thirds of thy gentleness be shown to women and to those that creep on the floor (little children) and to poets, and be not violent to the common people.

"Utter not swaggering speech, nor say thou wilt not yield what is right; it is a shameful thing to speak too stiffly unless that it be feasible to carry out thy words.

"So long as thou shalt live, thy lord forsake not; neither for gold nor for other reward in the world abandon one whom thou art pledged to protect.

"To a chief do not abuse his people, for that is no work for a gentleman.

"Be no talebearer, nor utterer of falsehoods; be not talkative nor rashly censorious. Stir not up strife against thee, however good a man thou be.

"Be no frequenter of the drinking-house, nor given to carping at the old; meddle not with a man of mean estate.

"Dispense thy meat freely, have no niggard for thy familiar.

"Force not thyself upon a chief, nor give him cause to speak ill of thee.

"Stick to thy gear, hold fast to thy arms till the stern fight with its weapon-glitter be well ended.

"Be more apt to give than to deny, and follow after gentleness, O son of Luga." `[I have in the main borrowed Standish Hayes O'Grady's vivid and racy translation of these adages of the Fianna. Silva Gadelica, Engl, transl., p. 115.]`

And the son of Luga, it is written, heeded these counsels and gave up his bad ways, and he became one of the best of Finn's men.

```

Rolleston's tale is taken from a much older text, in *The Colloquy*, which can be found in Standish O'Grady's *Silva Gadelica*.

The Colloquy.

"To mac Lugach then the chief `[Finn]` gave counsel, and his counsel had great virtue in it, and abode lastingly with mac Lugach; and Finn said:—

"'Mac Lugach! if armed service be thy design, in a great man's household be quiet, be surly in the rugged pass. Without a fault of his beat not thy hound; until thou ascertain [her guilt] bring not a charge against thy wife; in battle meddle not with a buffoon, for, O mac Lugach, he is but a fool. Censure not any if he be of grave repute; stand not up to take part in a brawl; neither have anything at all to do with either a mad man or a wicked one. Two-thirds of thy gentleness be shewn to women and to creepers on the floor [i.e. little children], likewise to men of art that make the *duans* and be not violent to the common people. With thy familiars, with them that are of thy counsel, hasten not to be the first into bed; perverse alliance shun, and all that is prohibited; yield not thy reverence to all. Utter not swaggering speech, nor say that thou wilt not render the thing that is right; for a shameful thing it is to speak too stiffly unless that it be feasible to carry out thy words. So long as in the universe thou shalt exist, thy lord forsake not; neither for gold nor for other valuable in the earthly world abandon thou thy guarantee [i.e. him that places himself under thy protection]. To a chief utter not strenuous criticism of his people; for it is not a 'good man's' [i.e. a gentleman's] occupation to abuse a great lord's people to their chief. Be not a continually tattling tale-bearer, nor a false one; be not loquacious, nor censorious rashly; be the multiplicity of thy chivalrous qualities what it may, yet have thou not the Irachts hostilely inclined to thee. Be not a frequenter of the drinking-house, nor given to carping at an ancient man; the conduct thou bearest recommended, that is the right: meddle not with a man of mean estate. Deal not in refusing of thy meat, and any that is penurious have not for a familiar; force not thyself upon a chief, nor give a chief lord occasion to speak ill of thee. Stick to thy raiment, hold fast to thine armature, until the stern fight with its weapon-glitter be well ended; never renounce to back thy luck, yet follow after gentleness, mac Lugach.' "
