# An Aside — Thomas the Rhymer

The story of Tír na nÓg has many similariities to that of Thomas the 
Rhymer. The first time I recall hearing the tale of Thomas the Rhymer was 
at FATE in 2020, in a sung version (with join-in chorus) by Scottish 
storyteller, Ruth Kirkpatrick which she credited to Duncan Williamson.

Story:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Rhymer

O true Thomas he lay on a Huntly bank
Beneath an Eilton tree
O when he saw a lady fair
Comin ridin oer the lea

O her mantle it was of the forest green
And her tresses they were so fair
And from every tass of her horse's mane
Hung twenty siller bells and mair

O Thomas he doffed off his hat
He got down upon his knee
He said - Lady you're the greatest queen
That ever I did see

O no O no O Thomas - she said
That name does not belong to me
For I have come from Elfinland
I have come to visit thee

And you maun come O Thomas - she said
You maun come along wi me
For I am bound for Elfinland
It is very far away

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode
O merrily they rode away
Until they came to a crystal river
That lay across their way

What river is this? O Thomas he said
O please to me do say
This is a river of tears - she said
That is spilled on this earth in one day

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode
They rode for a night and a day
Until they came to a red river
That lay across their way

What river is this? O Thomas he said
O please to me do say
This is a river of blood - she said
That is spilled on this earth in one day

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode
O merrily they rode away
Until they came to a thorny road
That lay across their way

What road is that? O Thomas he said
O please to me do tell
That is a road you must never lead
For that road it leads to hell

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode
Merrily they rode away
Until they came to a great orchard
That lay across their way

Lie down, lie down O Thomas - he cried
O it's hungry that I maun be
Lie down, lie down O Thomas he cried
Some fine apples I do see

O touch them not - the Elfin queen said
Please touch them not I say
For they are made from the curses
That fall on this earth in one day

Then reachin up into a tree
Into a tree so high
She plucked an apple from a tree
As they went riding by

O eat you this O Thomas - she said
As we go riding by
And it will give to you a tongue
You shall never tell a lie

So they rode and they rode and they merrily merrily rode
O they rode for a year and a day
Until they came to a great valley
That lay across their way

What place is this? O Thomas he said
O please to me do say
O this is Elfinland - she said
And it's here that you maun stay

So Thomas got a coat of lovely brown
And some shoes of elfin green
And for seven long years and a day
On earth he was never seen
