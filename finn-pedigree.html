<h1>Fionn’s Pedigree<a class="headerlink" href="#fionn-s-pedigree" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>The legend of Fionn Mac Cumhaill typically seems to start with Fionn, orphaned by the loss of his father at the Battle of Cnuchna, being taken by his mother to a place a safety, lest the members of the clann Morna, who killed Fionn’s father, sought also to put paid to any claim Fionn might have on the leadership.</p>
<p>But just in case there is some colour we can add to our tale in accounts that describe the death of Fionn’s father, Uail (Cumhaill, “Cool”), or perhaps his mother, Muirne’s, backstory, let’s see what some rather more literal translations of the source material have to say.</p>
<p>We begin with a translation by Kuno Meyer from 1904, around the time that Lady Gregory published <em>“Gods and fighting men”</em>. Several footnotes cite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">O'D.</span></code>, which refers to an earlier translation of the same source maerial by John O’Donovan, which we shall also meet below.</p>

<p>1.  THERE befell a meeting of valour and a contest of battle about the chieftaincy of the <em>fian</em> and about the high-stewardship of Ireland between Cumall, son of Tr6nm6r, and Urgriu, son of Lugaid Corr of the Luaigni. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[A</span> <span class="pre">famous</span> <span class="pre">military</span> <span class="pre">sept</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Meath,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> That Cumall was of the Corco Oche of Cuil Contuind, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;A</span> <span class="pre">territory</span> <span class="pre">situated</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">borders</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">present</span> <span class="pre">counties</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Meath</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Cavan,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> for to these the Ui Tairrsig, Cumall’s tribe, belonged. Torba, daughter of Eochaman of the Erne, was the wife of Cumall, until he married Muirne of the fair neck.</p>
<p>2.  Then the battle of Cnucha [<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Now</span> <span class="pre">Castleknock,</span> <span class="pre">near</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Liffey,</span> <span class="pre">Co.</span> <span class="pre">Dublin.]</span></code> was fought between them, to wit, between Cumall and Urgriu. Daire the Red, son of Echaid the Fair, son of Coirpre the Valorous, son of Muiredach, and his son Aed were fighting the battle along with Urgriu. Another name for that Daire was Morna Wryneck. So the battle was fought. Luchet and Aed, son of Morna, met in the battle. Luchet wounded Aed, and destroyed one of his eyes, whence the name of Goll (ix. the One-eyed) clave to him from that time forth. Luchet fell by Goll. The man who kept Cumall’s treasure-bag wounded Cumall in the battle. Cumall fell in the battle by Goll, son of Morna, who carried off his spoils and his head, whence there was a hereditary feud between Finn and the sons of Morna.</p>
<p>3.  Hence sang the shanachie : —</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>” Goll, son of Daire the Red, with fame,<br />
Son of Echaid the Fair, of valour fair,<br />
Son of Cairpre the Valorous with valour.<br />
Son of Muiredach from Findmag.” <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[A</span> <span class="pre">plain</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">barony</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Athlone,</span> <span class="pre">Co.</span> <span class="pre">Roscommon,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code></p>
<p>” Goll slew Luchet of the hundreds<br />

Fell by the son of Morna.</p>
<p>” By him fell great Cumall<br />
In the battle of Cnucha of the hosts.<br />
‘Tis for the chieftaincy of Erin’s fian<br />
That they waged the stout battle.</p>
<p>The children of Moma were in the battle<br />

<p>” Aed was the name of the son of Daire<br />

</div></blockquote>
<p>4.  Cumall left his wife Muirne pregnant. And she brings forth a son, to whom the name of Demne was given. Fiacail, son of Conchenn, and Bodbmall the druidess, and the Grey one of Luachair came to Muirne, and carry away the boy, for his mother durst not let him be with her. Muirne afterwards slept with Gleor Red-hand, king of the Lamraige, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;</span> <span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">people</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Kerry,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> whence* the saying, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Read</span> <span class="pre">*conid</span> <span class="pre">[d]eiside*.]</span></code> ‘ Finn, son of Gleor.’ Bodbmall, however, and the Grey one, and the boy with them, went into the forest of Slieve Bloom. There the boy was secretly reared That was indeed necessary, for many a sturdy stalwart youth, and many a venomous hostile warrior and angry fierce champion of the warriors of the Luaigni and of the sons of Morna were lying in wait for that boy, and for Tulcha, the son of Cumall. In that manner then those two women-warriors reared him for a long time.</p>
<p>5.  Then, at the end of six years, his mother came to visit her son, for she had been told that he was in that place, and besides, she was afraid of the sons of Morna for him. However, she passed from one wilderness to another, until she reached the forest of Slieve Bloom. She found the hunting-booth and the boy asleep in it. And then she lifts the boy to her bosom, and presses him to her, and she pregnant at the time. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">Irish</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">*ocus</span> <span class="pre">si</span> <span class="pre">irom</span> <span class="pre">iarum*</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">should</span> <span class="pre">not,</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">think,</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">has</span> <span class="pre">been</span> <span class="pre">suggested,</span> <span class="pre">be</span> <span class="pre">rendered</span> <span class="pre">'</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">she</span> <span class="pre">pregnant</span> <span class="pre">thereafter,'</span> <span class="pre">*iarum*</span> <span class="pre">here</span> <span class="pre">having</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">force</span> <span class="pre">oi</span> <span class="pre">*tra*</span> <span class="pre">(see</span> <span class="pre">Windisch,</span> <span class="pre">Wörterbuch,</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">613)</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">*iarsin*.</span> <span class="pre">Besides,</span> <span class="pre">*ocus</span> <span class="pre">si*</span> <span class="pre">denotes</span> <span class="pre">an</span> <span class="pre">accompanying</span> <span class="pre">circumstance.]</span></code> It was then she made the quatrains, fondling her son : —</p>

He went to contend in running or in hurling with them. He came again the next day, and they put one-fourth of their number against him. Again they come with one-third of their number against him. However, at last they all go against him, and he won his game from them all.</p>
<p>9.  “What is thy name?” they said. “Demne,” said he. The youths tell that to the man of the stronghold. ” Then kill him, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Read</span> <span class="pre">*marbid-si</span> <span class="pre">de</span> <span class="pre">é*.]</span></code> if ye know how to do it — if ye are able to do it,” said he. ” We should not be able to do aught to him,” said they. ” Did he tell you his name ? ” says he. ” He said,” say they, ” that his name was Demne.” ” What does he look like ? ” said he. ” A shapely fair (<em>finn</em>) youth,” said they. ” Then Demne shall be named Finn (the Fair),” said he. Whence the youths used to call him Finn.</p>
<p>10.  He came to them on the next day, and went to them at their game. All together they throw their hurlets at him. He turns among them, and throws seven of them to the ground. He went from them into the forest of Slieve Bloom.</p>
<p>11.  Then, at the end of a week, he came back to the same place. The youths were swimming in a lake that was close by. The youths challenge him to come and try to drown them. Thereupon he jumps into the lake to them, and drowns nine of them in the lake. And after that he goes to Slieve Bloom. ” Who drowned the youths ? ” everybody asks. ” Finn,” say they. So that henceforth [the name] Finn clave to him.</p>
<p>12.  Once he went forth across Slieve Bloom, and the two women-warriors together with him, when a fleet herd of wild deer is seen [by them] on the ridge of the mountain. ” Alas ! ” say the two old women, ” that we cannot get hold of one of those !” <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Read</span> <span class="pre">ni</span> <span class="pre">tic</span> <span class="pre">din</span> <span class="pre">astud,</span> <span class="pre">&amp;c.]</span></code> “<em>I</em> can,” [says Finn], and he dashes upon them, and lays hold of two bucks among them, and brings them with him to their hunting-booth. After that he would hunt for them constantly. ” Go from us now, lad,” said the women-warriors to him, ” for the sons of Morna are watching to kill thee.”</p>
<p>13.  Alone he went from them until he reached Lough Leane, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">great</span> <span class="pre">Lake</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Killarney.]</span></code> above Luachair <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[i.e.</span> <span class="pre">Luchair</span> <span class="pre">Dedad,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;a</span> <span class="pre">district</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Kerry,</span> <span class="pre">containing</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">two</span> <span class="pre">Pap</span> <span class="pre">mountains,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code>,  and there he took military service with the king of Bantry. At that place he did not make himself known. However, there was not at that time a hunter his equal. Thus said the king to him : — ” If Cumall had left a son,” says he, ” one would think thou wast he. However, we have not heard of his leaving a son, except Tulcha mac Cumaill, and he is in military service with the king of Scotland.”</p>
<p>14.  He afterwards bids farewell to the king, and goes from them to Carbrige, which at this day is [called] Kerry, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">territory</span> <span class="pre">so</span> <span class="pre">called</span> <span class="pre">extended</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">ancient</span> <span class="pre">times</span> <span class="pre">only</span> <span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">Tralee</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Shannon,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> and takes military service with the king of that land. Then, on a certain day, the king came to play <em>fidchell</em>. He was prompted by Finn, and won seven games one after another. ” Who art thou ? ” says the king. ” The son of a peasant of the Luaigni of Tara, says he. “No,” says the king, “but thou art the son whom Muirne bore to Cumall, and be here no longer, lest thou be slain [while] under my protection.”</p>

Then he went forth to Cullen <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;In</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Tipperary,</span> <span class="pre">near</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">borders</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Limerick,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> of the Ui Cuanach <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Coonagh</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">now</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">barony,</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">Limerick.]</span></code>, to the house of Lochán, a chief smith, who had a very beautiful daughter, Cruithne by name. She fell in love with the youth. ” I shall give thee my daughter, though I know not who thou art.” Thereupon the girl slept with the youth. ” Make spears for me,” said the youth to the smith. So Lochán made two spears for him. He then bade farewell to Lochán, and went away, ” My son,” says Lochán, ” do not go upon the road on which is the sow called the Beo.” She it was that devastated the midlands of Munster. But what happened to the youth was to go upon the very road on which the sow was. Then the sow charged him ; but he thrust his spear at her, so that it went through her, and left her without life. Then he takes the head of the sow with him to the smith as a bridal gift for his daughter. Hence is Slieve Muck <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*Sliab</span> <span class="pre">Muicce*,</span> <span class="pre">'</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Mountain</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Sow.']</span></code> in Munster.</p>
<p>16.  After that the youth went onwards into Connaught to seek Crimall, the son of Trénmér. As he was on his way, he heard the wail of a woman. He went towards it, and saw a woman ; and now it was tears of blood, and now a gush of blood, so that her mouth was red. ” Thou art red-mouthed, woman ! says he. ” Good cause have I,” says she, ” for my only son has been slain by a tall, very terrible warrior who came in my way. ” What was thy son’s name ?” says he. ” Glonda was his name,” says she.

Then Finn went in pursuit of the warrior, and they fight a combat, and he fell by him. This is how he was : he had the treasure-bag with him, to wit, the treasures of Cumall. He who had fallen there was the Grey one of Luachair, who had dealt the first wound to Cumall in the battle of Cnucha.</p>
<p>17.  Thereupon he goes into Connaught, and finds Crimall as an old man in a desert wood there, and a number of the old <em>fian</em> together with him ; and it is they who did the hunting for him. Then he shows (?) him the bag, and told him his story from beginning to end ; how he had slain the man of the treasures. Finn bade farewell to Crimall, and went to learn poetry from Finnéces, who was on the Boyne. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[For</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">poets</span> <span class="pre">thought</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">place</span> <span class="pre">where</span> <span class="pre">poetry</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">revealed</span> <span class="pre">always</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">upon</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">brink</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">water</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span> <span class="pre">(*ar</span> <span class="pre">bd</span> <span class="pre">baile</span> <span class="pre">fallsigthe</span> <span class="pre">éicsi</span> <span class="pre">dogrés</span> <span class="pre">lasna</span> <span class="pre">filedu</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">brú</span> <span class="pre">usci*),</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">186</span> <span class="pre">a.]</span></code> He durst not remain in Ireland else, until he took to poetry, for fear of the son of Urgriu, and of the sons of Morna.</p>
<p>18.  Seven years Finnéces had been on the Boyne, watching the salmon of Fec’s Pool <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[A</span> <span class="pre">deep</span> <span class="pre">pool</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">River</span> <span class="pre">Boyne,</span> <span class="pre">near</span> <span class="pre">Fer/a</span> <span class="pre">Fer</span> <span class="pre">Fecc,</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">ancient</span> <span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">village</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Slane,</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">river,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code>; for it had been prophesied of him that he would eat the salmon of Féc, when nothing would remain unknown to him. The salmon was found, and Demne was then ordered to cook the salmon; and the poet told him not to eat anything of the salmon. The youth brought him the salmon after cooking it. ” Hast thou eaten anything of the salmon, my lad ?” says the poet. ” No,” says the youth, ” but I burned my thumb, and put it into my mouth afterwards.” “What is thy name, my lad?” says he. “Demne,” says the youth. ” Finn is thy name, my lad,” says he ; ” and to thee was the salmon given to be eaten, and verily thou art the Finn.” Thereupon the youth eats the salmon. It is that which gave the knowledge to Finn, to wit, whenever he put his thumb into his mouth, and sang through <em>teinm ldida</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;Illumination</span> <span class="pre">(?)</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">song.&quot;]</span></code> then whatever he had been ignorant of would be revealed to him.</p>

The dust-coloured cuckoo calls aloud : Welcome, splendid summer ! The bitterness of bad weather is past, the boughs of the wood are a thicket.<br />
Summer cuts the river down, the swift herd of horses seeks the pool, the long hair of the heather is outspread, the soft white bog-down grows.<br />
Panic startles the heart of the deer, the smooth sea runs apace, — season when ocean sinks asleep, — blossom covers the world.<br />
Bees with puny strength carry a goodly burden, the harvest of blossoms ; up the mountain-side kine take with them mud, the ant makes a rich meal.<br />
The harp of the forest sounds music, the sail gathers — perfect peace. Colour has settled on every height, haze on the lake of full waters.<br />
The corncrake, a strenuous bard, discourses ; the lofty virgin waterfall sings a welcome to the warm pool ; the talk of the rushes is come.<br />
Light swallows dart aloft, loud melody reaches round the hill, the soft rich mast buds, the stuttering quagmire rehearses.<br />
The peat-bog is as the raven’s coat, the loud cuckoo bids welcome, the speckled fish leaps, strong is the bound of the swift warrior.<br />
Man flourishes, the maiden buds in her fair strong pride ; perfect each forest from top to ground, perfect each great stately plain.<br />
Delightful is the season’s splendour, rough winter has gone, white is every fruitful wood, a joyous peace is summer.<br />
A flock of birds settles in the midst of meadows; the green field rustles, wbeiein is a brawling white stream.<br />
A wild longing is on you to race horses, the ranked host is ranged around : a bright shaft has been shot into the land, so that the water-flag is gold beneath it.<br />
A timorous tiny persistent little fellow sings at the top of his voice, the lark sings clear tidings : surpassing May-day of delicate colours !</p>
<p>21.  However, Finn went to Cethern, the son of Fintan, further to learn poetry with him. At that time there was a very beautiful maiden in Bri Ele, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Now</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Hill</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Croghan,</span> <span class="pre">King's</span> <span class="pre">County.</span> <span class="pre">Cf.</span> <span class="pre">Cruachan</span> <span class="pre">Brig</span> <span class="pre">Ele,</span> <span class="pre">s.</span> <span class="pre">26.]</span></code> that is to say, in the fairy-knoll of Bri Ele, and the name of that maiden was Ele. The men of Ireland were at feud about that maiden. One man after another went to woo her. Every year on Hallowe’en the wooing used to take place ; for the fairy-knolls of Ireland were always open about Hallowe’en ; for on Hallowe’en nothing could ever be hidden in the fairy-knolls. To each man that went to woo her this used to happen : one of his people was slain. This was done to mark the occasion, nor was it ever found out who did it.</p>
<p>22.  Like everybody else, the poet Cethern went to woo the maiden. However, Finn did not like the poet’s going on that errand. At that time the name of Cumall’s son was Finnéces. As they went to the wooing they formed themselves into three bands. There were nine in each band. As they went towards the fairy-knoll, a man of their people was slain between them ; and it was not known who had slain him. Oircbel the poet was the name of the man that was slain there. Hence is Fert Oircbeil (the Grave of O.) in Clonfad. Thereupon they separated, and Finn went from them and … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[I</span> <span class="pre">do</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">know</span> <span class="pre">what</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">*ni</span> <span class="pre">thaire*]</span></code> However, Finn thought it a grievance and a great disgrace. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">whole</span> <span class="pre">incident</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">mentioned</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">poem</span> <span class="pre">by</span> <span class="pre">Gilla</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Chomded</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">144</span> <span class="pre">b,</span> <span class="pre">44</span> <span class="pre">ff.]</span></code></p>

To him, then, Finn made his complaint, and told him how the man had been slain among them in the fairy-knoll.

<p>24.  Now, when Finn was there between them, on Hallowe’en night, he saw the two fairy-knolls opened around him, even the two strongholds, their ramparts having vanished before them. And he saw a great fire in either of the two strongholds ; and he heard a voice from one of them, which said : ” Is your sweet food good ? ” ” Good, indeed ! ” said a voice in the other fairy-knoll. ” A question. Shall anything be taken from us to you ? ” ” If that be given to us, something will be given to you in return.” While Finn was there he saw a man coming out of the fairy-knoll. A kneading-trough was in his hand with a … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[I</span> <span class="pre">do</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">know</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">meaning</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">*slainsi*.]</span></code> pig upon it, and a cooked calf, and a bunch of wild garlic upon it. That was Hallowe’en. The man came past Finn to reach the other knoll. Finn made a cast with the spear of Fiacail mac Conchinn. He hurled it southward from him towards Slieve-margue. Then said Finn : ” If the spear should reach any one of us, may he escape (?) alive from it ! I think this was a revenge for my comrade.” <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[This</span> <span class="pre">incident</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">referred</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">poem</span> <span class="pre">beginning</span> <span class="pre">*Échta</span> <span class="pre">Lagen</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">Leth</span> <span class="pre">Chuind*,</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">48</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">41</span> <span class="pre">;</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">again</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Gilla</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Chomded*s</span> <span class="pre">poem,</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">145</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">2.]</span></code></p>
<p>25.  That passes, till forthwith he heard a lament, and a great wail, saying : —</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“On the Barrow, by a sharp-pointed spear,<br />
Aed, Fidga’s son, has fallen :<br />
By the spear of Fiacail, Codna’s son,<br />
Finn has slain him … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*iar</span> <span class="pre">n-imdai*</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">*ic</span> <span class="pre">feiss*,</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">144</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">52.]</span></code> “</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Then Fiacail came to Finn, and was at the two Paps of Anu. Fiacail asked him whom he had slain. (“I know not,” saith Finn, “whether any good has come from the cast which I have thrown.” ” Tis likely, indeed,” said Fiacail, ” that some one has been slain. It seems to me if thou do not do it to-night, thou wilt not do it to the end of another year.” However, Finn said that he had sent a cast, and that it seemed likely to him that it had reached some one. And he heard a great wailing in the fairy-knoll, saying : —</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Venom is this spear,<br />
And venomous he whose it is,<br />
Venomous whoever threw it,<br />
Venom for him whom it laid low.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>26.  Outside the fairy-knoll of Cruachan Brig Ele Finn seized a woman in pledge for his spear. The woman promised to send out the spear if he released her. Finn let the woman from him into the knoll. Then, as she went into the knoll the woman said : —</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Venom the spear,<br />
And venom the hand that threw it !<br />
If it is not cast out of the knoll,<br />
A murrain will seize Ihe land.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thereupon the spear is thrown out, and Finn takes it with him to where Fiacail was. ” Well,” said Fiacail, ” keep the spear with which thou hast done the famous deed.” Then Fiacail said the occasion was fortunate, since the man had been slain who had killed Finn’s comrade. ” He whom thou hast slain here,” said he, ” ‘tis he who used to kill every man that came to woo the maiden, because it is he who loved the maiden.”</p>
<p>27.  Thereupon Finn and Fiacail went onward. Now, Fiacail had a tryst with the <em>fian</em> at Inver Colptha. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">estuary</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Boyne.</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code> Then he said to Finn that they should go home … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[I</span> <span class="pre">cannot</span> <span class="pre">translate</span> <span class="pre">*gid</span> <span class="pre">daimh*.]</span></code> since their business was finished. Said Finn : ” Let me go with thee,” says he. ” I do not wish thee to go with me,” says Fiacail, ” lest thy strength should fail thee.” ” I shall find out,” says Finn. Then they went forth. Twelve balls of lead were round the neck of Fiacail to hem his vigour, such was his swiftness. He would throw one ball after another from him, and Finn took them with him, and (yet) Fiacail’s running was no swifter than Finn’s.</p>
<p>28.  They reach Inver Colptha. Then Finn brought all the twelve balls of lead to him, and he was pleased. That night they slept there. Then they make Finn keep watch that night, and he was told to wake the warrior if he heard any [cry of] outrage. Now, one hour of the night, as Finn was watching, he heard a cry from the north, and did not wake the warrior. He went alone in the direction of the cry to Slieve Slanga. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Now</span> <span class="pre">Slieve</span> <span class="pre">Donard,</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">Down.]</span></code> While Finn was there, among the men of Ulster, at the hour of midnight, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[This</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">take</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">be</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">meaning</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">*tráth</span> <span class="pre">nóna</span> <span class="pre">do</span> <span class="pre">aidchi*.]</span></code> he overtook three women before him, at a green mound, with horns (?) of fairy-women.

<p>Letter addressed by Dr. John O’Donovan, to the President of the Ossianic Society.</p>
<p>Dublin, Dec. 27th, 1858.</p>
<p>Dear Sir— Having, at your request, undertaken to translate into English — to lengthen out the abbreviations, and to fix the grammatical endings of the contracted words, in this notice of the boyish exploits of the celebrated Finn Mac Cumhaill, the Fingal of Mac Pherson’s Ossian, — I beg to offer you a few obserrations on the age and importance of the little tract, as well as of the manuscript from which it has been taken. This tract was copied letter for letter, and contraction for contraction from a fragment of the Psalter of Cashel now preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford (<em>Laud.</em> 610), by the Rev. Euseby D. Cleayer, M. A., of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1854, and now curate of S. Barnabas, Pimlico, London, whose progress in the study of the Irish language is truly wonderful, considering the slight advantages of oral instruction which he has possessed. He has copied this little tract so faithfully that I was able to understand it as well as if I had the original manuscript before me. No artist ever copied a portrait or inscription more accurately. This manuscript was examined in the year 1844 by the Rev. Dr. Todd, S.F.T.C.D., who published a full account of its contents in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. 2, p. 336, sq. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[archive.org:proceedingsofroy02proc]</span></code> In 1846 I examined it again with the most anxious care, and published a brief notice of its more important contents in the introduction to Leabhar na g-Ceart. It consists of 292 pages folio, vellum, and was transcribed in 1453 by John Boy O’Clery and others at Pottlerath, in the barony of Crannagh, and county of Kilkenny, for Edmund Butler, the head of the sept of Mac Richard, who afterwards became Earls of Ormonde. This manuscript remained in the possession of Mac Richard Butler till the year 1462, when Ormonde aod he were defeated in a battle fought at Baile-an-phoill, now Pilltown, in the barony of Iverk, county of Kilkenny, by Thomas, Earl of Desmond, to whom he was obliged to give up this very copy of the Psalter of Cashel, together with another manuscript (now unknown), called the Book of Carrick-on-Suir. This fact appears from a memorandum on foL 110, p. b, of which the followiog is a literal translation :—</p>
<p>” This was the Psalter of Mac Richard Butler, until the defeat at Baile-an phoill, was giren to the Earl of Ormonde, and to Mac Richard by the Earl of Desmond (Thomas), when this book and the book of Carrick, were obtained in the redemption of Mac Richard ; and it was this Mac Richard that had these books transcribed for his own use ; and they remained in his possession until Thomas, Earl of Desmond, wrested them from him.”</p>
<p>The foregoing memorandum was written in the manuscript, while it was in the possession of Thomas, Earl of Desmond, whose name ” Thomas, of Desmond,” appears in English, in his own hand, on fol. 92, a., See <em>Leahhar na g-Ceart</em>, Introduction, pp. xxviii—xxx. The publication of this manuscript, as it stands, would be a great desideratum in Irish literature, and I trust that Sir John Romilly will not think it unworthy of his attention.</p>
<p>I am of opinion that this little tract is of great antiquity, and contains, perhaps, the oldest account we have remaining of Finn and his cotemporaries. You will observe that the style is extremely simple, and altogether devoid of that redundancy of epithets which characterises the prose compositions of later ages, which are equalled only by those of <em>“Ei famoso Feliciano de Silva.”</em></p>
<p>The celebrated Irish antiquary, Duald Mac Firbis, in his genealogical work, pp. 435, 436, gives various pedigrees of the famous Irish hero, Finn Mac Cumhaill. Some deduce his descent from the Orbhraighe of Druim Inmocht, others from the Coroo Oiche, a sept of the ni-Fidhgeinte, who were seated in the present county of Limerick. Some state that he sprung fh&gt;m the Ui-Tairsigh of Ui-Failghe, a plebeian sept, while other genealogists maintain that he came of the Ui-Tairsigh of the Luaighni Teamhrach of Fera-Cul in Bregia, which was one of the three septs from whom the chief leader of the Fians, or Irish militiai was elected. Mac Firbis, however, states that this discrepancy must have arisen from mistaking one Finn for another ; but that by far the greater number of the authentic Irish authorities agree in deducing the pedigree of the famous Finn Mac Cumhaill from Nuada Neacht, the fourth son of Sedna Sithbhaic, the ancestor of the kings of Leinster.</p>
<p>By the mother’s side, Finn Mac Cumhaill was descended from Tadhg, son of Nuadhat, son of Aice, son of Daite, son of Brocan, son of Fintan of Tuath-Daite in Bregia. This Mac Firbis believes to be his true maternal descent, though others state that his mother was Torba, daughter of Echuman of the Ernaans of Dun-Cearmna (the old head of Kinsale, in the county of Cork), and that he had a half-brother by the mother’s side, who was called Finn Mac Gleoir.</p>
<p>Mac Firbis adds that Finn Mac Camhaill possessed, in right of his office of leader of the Fians, seven hallys, or townlands, out of every tricha-ched, or hundred, in Ireland ; that he was bom in the third year of the reign of Conn of the Hundred Battles, and died in the year 283.</p>
<p>Some genealogical books give the pedigree of our hero thus : — Finn, son of Cumhall, son of Trénmor, son of Subalt, son of Ealtan, son of Baiscne, son of Nuada Necht : others, Finn, son of Cumhall, son of Baiscne, son of Trénmor, son of Ferdarath, son of Goll, son of Forgall, son of Daire, son of Deaghaidh, son of Sin ; but of the yarious pedigrees of our hero which Mac Firbis has copied from Irish authorities, the following is the only one that can be considered authentic : —</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Nuada Necht,</p></li>
<li><p>Fergus Fallge, ancestor of the Kings of Leinster,</p></li>
<li><p>Boesa Buadh, 3. So-alt,</p></li>
<li><p>Finn, the poet, king of Leinster, 4. Alt,</p></li>
<li><p>Conchobhar Abhraruadh, 5. Cairbre Qarbhroin,</p></li>
<li><p>Moghcorb, king of Leinster, 6. Baeiscne,</p></li>
<li><p>Cucorb, king of Leinster, 7. Modh,</p></li>
<li><p>Nia Corb, 8. Buan,</p></li>
<li><p>Cormac Gealtagaoith, 9. Fergus,</p></li>
<li><p>Feilimidh Firurglais, 10. Trendorn,</p></li>
<li><p>Cathaeir Mor (A.D., 177.), monarch of Ireland, 11. Trenmor,</p></li>
<li><p>Cumhall,</p></li>
<li><p>Finn Mac Cumhaill, sl. 284.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>He had a sister named <em>Sidh</em>, who was proverbial in Ireland for her fleetness of foot, and who was the mother of Caoilte Mac Ronain, also famous in the Fenian tales for his agility. He had another sister, Seogen, who was the mother of Cobhthach, son of Crunnchu.</p>
<p>I have always believed that Finn Mac Cumhaill was a real historical personage, and not a myth or god of war, like the Hercules of the Greeks, the Odin of the Scandinavians, or the Siegfried of the Germans. He was the son-in-law of the famous Cormac Mac Airt monarch of Ireland, and the general of his standing army. He was slain in the year A.D., 284, according to the Annals of Tighemach, a period to which our authentic history unquestionably reaches. (See Ogygia, part iii, c. 70).</p>
<p>This celebrated warrior was, as we have seen, of the regal line of the kings of Leinster, of the Milesian or Scotic race (for my ingenious friend Mr. Herbert F. Hore has theorised in vain to prove him of Scandinavian origin) ; he had two residences in Leinster, one at Allen ( Almhain,) in the present county of Kildare, and the other at Moyelly in the (now) King’s County, both of which descended to him from his ancestors. Pinkerton, the most critical and sceptical writer that has ever treated of Irish and Scottish history, has the following remarkable words, in which he expresses his conviction of Finn’s undoubted historical existence : —</p>
<p>” He seems,” says he, “to have been a man of great talents for the age, and of celebrity in arms. His formation of a regular standing army, trained to war, in which all the Irish accounts agree, seems to have been a rude imitation of the Roman legions in Britain. The idea, though simple enough, shows prudence, for such a force alone, could have coped with the Romans had they invaded Ireland. But this machine, which surprised a rude age, and seems the basis of all Finn’s fame, like some other great schemes, only lived in its author, and expired soon after him.” — Inquiry into the History of Scotland, vol. ii, p. 77.</p>
<p>Our own poet and historian, Moore, who read all that had been written by the Mac Phersons and the modern critics on the history of Finn, expresses his conviction that he was a real man of flesh and blood, and no god of war or poetical creation. He concludes his account of him in the following poetical strain.</p>
<p>” It has been the fate of this popular Irish hero, after a long course of traditional renown in his country, where his name still lives, not only in legends and songs, but yet in the more indelible record of scenery connected with his memory, to have been all at once transferred by adoption to another country (Scotland), and start under a new but false shape, into a fresh career of fame.” — History of Ireland, vol. i. p. 133.</p>
<p>The only known descendants of our hero, now known to exist, are the Dal-Cais Le. O’Briens of Munster and their correlatives. Cormac Gas, king of Munster, who married Samhair (Samaria), the daughter of Finn by Gráinè, daughter of Cormac Mac Airt, monarch of Ireland, and had by her, according to the Irish genealogists, three sons, Tinnè and Connla, of whose race nothing is known, and Fearcorb, the progenitor of the Dal Cais, the hereditary enemies of the race of Conn of the Hundred Battles. After the death of Finn, the monarch Cairbre Liffechair, son of Cormac, the grandson of Conn of the Hundred Battles, disbanded and outlawed the Clanna-Baeiscnè, of whom Finn was then the head, and retained in his service their enemies, the Clanna-Morna, a military tribe of the Firbolgs of Connacht. The Clanna-Baeiscè then repaired to Munster to their relative, Fearcorb, who retained them in his service, contrary to the orders of the Irish monarch. This led to the bloody battle of Gabhra (near the Boyne in Meath), in which the two rival military tribes slaughtered each other almost to extermination. In the heat of the action, Oscar, the grandson of Finn (and son of Oisin,) met the monarch in single combat ; but fell, and the monarch retiring from the combat, was met by his own relative Semeon, one of the Fotharta, (a tribe that had been expelled into Leinster) who fell upon him after being severely wounded in the dreadful combat with Oscar, and despatched him by a single blow.</p>
<p>Oisin and Caeilte Mac Ronain survived all the followers of our hero, and are fabled to have lived down to the time of St. Patrick (A.D. 432), to whom they related the wonderful exploits of Finn and his cotemporaries. This, however, is incredible ; but it is highly probable that both lived to converse with some Christian missionaries who preceded the great apostle of Ireland, and who found it difficult to convert them from their pagan notions.</p>
<p>There is a very curious dialogue, partly preserved in the book of Lismore, and partly in a MS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, said to have been carried on between Caeilte, son of Ronan, and St. Patrick. This dialogue, notvithstanding ita anachronism, or perhaps rather misnomer, is of great value to the Irish linguist, topographer, and antiquary, on account of the curious ancient forms of the language which it preserves, and the various forts, mounds, sepulchres, plains, mountains, estuaries and rivers which it mentions by their primitive and mediaeval names.</p>
<p>Hoping that this tract will soon see the light under your auspices, as President of our Society,</p>
<p>I remain, dear Sir,</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>JOHN O’DONOVAN.</p>

<p>The translation then follows. We note that in the translation of the pernultimate stanza of the song claimed to be sung about Fionn and the sons of Morna, the footnote only provides a geohraphical, rather than explanatory context regarding their final meeting at Teamhair Luachra (Tara Luachra in Kuno Meyer’s account). Which is to say: no mention of the pigs, that we will hear about from another translated poem.</p>

<p>The woman afterwards bids farewell to the heroines, and asked them if they would take charge of him till he should be of heroic age ; and the son was afterwards reared by them till he was fit for hunting.</p>

<p>He went forth one day alone [and never halted] till he reached Magh Life, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[i.e.,</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">plain</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Liffey;</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">very</span> <span class="pre">level</span> <span class="pre">plain</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">county</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Kildare,</span> <span class="pre">through</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">river</span> <span class="pre">Liffey</span> <span class="pre">winds</span> <span class="pre">its</span> <span class="pre">course.]</span></code> and on the green of a certain Dun [<em>fort</em>] there he saw youths hurling. He went to contend in agility or to hurl along with them. He came with them next day, and they sent the fourth of their number against him. He came again, and they sent the third of their number against him, and finally they went all against him, and he won one game from them all. What is thy name said they?</p>
<p>Deimne replied he. The youths tell this to the owner of the dun [<em>fort</em>] ” Do ye kill him if he comes again, if ye are able,” said he. We are not able to do aught unto him, replied they ; Deinme is his name. What is his appearance ? said he. He is a well-shaped fair [<em>finn</em>] youth, replied they, Deimne shall be named Finn therefore, said he. And hence these young men used to call him Finn,</p>
<p>He came the next day to them, and joined them in their game, they attacked him all together, with their hurlets, but he made at them and prostrated seven of them, and [then] made off from them into the forests of Sliabh Bladhma.</p>
<p>He afterwards returned at the end of a week to the same place. What the youths were at [then] was swimming in the lake which was close by [the dun.] The youths challenged him to swim with them. He plunged into the lake to them, and afterwards drowned nine of them in the lake, and then made to Bliabh Bladhma himself. Who drowned the youths ? enquired all. Finn, replied they [i.e. the survivors]. And from this the name of Finn clung to him [among all who heard of this deed of drowning.]</p>
<p>He came forth on one occasion out beyond Sliabh Bladhma, the two heroines being along with him, and they perceived a fleet herd of the wild deer of the forest of the mountain. Alas ; said the two old women, that we cannot detain one of these with us. I can, [said Finn] and he ran upon them, and catching two bucks of them, brings them with him to his hunting booth. After this he used to himt for them constantly. Depart from us now, young man, said the female warriors to him, for the sons of Morna are watching to kill thee.</p>
<p>He went away from them alone [and halted not,] till he reached Loch Lein <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*Loch</span> <span class="pre">Lein*,</span> <span class="pre">now</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Lakes</span> <span class="pre">at</span> <span class="pre">Killamey</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Kerry.]</span></code>, and over Luachair <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*Luachra*,</span> <span class="pre">i.e.,</span> <span class="pre">Luachair</span> <span class="pre">Deaghaidh,</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">district</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">now</span> <span class="pre">county</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Kerry,</span> <span class="pre">containing</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">two</span> <span class="pre">Pap</span> <span class="pre">mountains.]</span></code>, till he hired in military service, with the king of Bentraighe. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[a</span> <span class="pre">district</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">South</span> <span class="pre">Munster,</span> <span class="pre">believed</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">have</span> <span class="pre">been</span> <span class="pre">coextensive</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">barony</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Bantry</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">county</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Cork.]</span></code> He did not go by any name here, but there was not at this time a hunter like him, and so the king said to him : if Cumhall had left any son, methinks thou art he, but we have not heard of Cumhall having left any son, but Tulcha Mac Cumhaill, but he is in military service with the king of Albain. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Albain*,</span> <span class="pre">i.e.,</span> <span class="pre">Scotland.]</span></code></p>

I will give thee my daughter, said the smith, although I know not who thou art. The daughter then cohabited with the unknown youth. Make lances for me, said the youth, to the smith. Lochan then made two spears for him. He then bade farewell to Lochan, and went his way. My son, said Lochan, do not go on the passage on which the boar called Beo is usually [to be] seen ; it has devastated the [whole of] Middle Munster. But the youth happened to go on the very pass where the pig was. The pig afterwards rushed at him ! but he made a thrust of his spear at it, and drove it through it, so that he left it lifeless, and he brought the head of the pig with him to the smith as a dower for his daughter.

He went towards <span style="background: #69E2FB;">her,</span> and <span style="background: #69E2FB;">viewed the</span> woman <span style="background: #69E2FB;">: The first tear she shed</span> was <span style="background: #69E2FB;">a tear</span> of <span style="background: #69E2FB;">blood;</span> and <span style="background: #69E2FB;">the other was</span> a gush of blood, so that her mouth was red.

O'Flaherty states that our hero assisted his father-in-law Cormac son of Art, in compiling codes of laws ; and the Life of St Columkille compiled by Manus O'Donnell, states that he possessed the gift of prophecy, and foretold the birth and future greatness of St. Columbkille.]` O youth," said he, and it was to thee the salmon was [really] given, [in the prophecy]</span> to be <span style="background: #69E2FB;">eaten [not to me],</span> and thou art the <span style="background: #69E2FB;">Finn truly.

Bees with puny strength carry a goodly burden, the harvest of blossoms ; up the mountain-side kine take with them mud, the ant makes a rich meal. The harp of the forest sounds music, the sail gathers — perfect peace. Colour has settled on every height, haze on the lake of full waters. The corncrake, a strenuous bard, discourses ; the lofty virgin waterfall sings a</span> welcome <span style="background: #69E2FB;">to the warm pool ; the talk of the rushes is come.

<p>The Battle of Cnucha ; a médiéval Irish text, with a translation, by W. M. Hennessy
W. M. Hennessy, 1875</p>
<p>pp.86-91</p>
<p>THE BATTLE OF CNUCHA.</p>
<p>[The principal value of the following story from <em>Lebor na huidre</em>, an Irish Ms. written circa A. D, 1100, is that it presents probably the oldest written form of one important fragment of the legendary history so widely extended among the Celtic family in the British Islands, in which Find mac Cumhaill (or Fingal) occupies the part of principal hero, and Oisin, or Ossian, the part of narrator. The style of the narrative, so terse and simple, is in favourable contrast with the prosy, redundant, oftentimes absurdly bombastic compositions of a later period, and justifies the opinion of scholars that it was written some centuries earlier than the date of the Ms. from which the présent text has been copied. The language, also, is singularly pure; on which account care has been taken to print in different type the portions of words represented by abbreviations in the original.</p>
<p>The admirers of Mac Pherson’s ambitious attempt to localize the Ossianic legend within the narrow limits of North Britain, now happily through the growth of a more independent and unselfish spirit of criticism fast becoming fewer in number, will see with surprise that all the characters in this most ancient fragment of the literature of which he would rob all other branches of the Celtic race, are purely Irish. The places mentioned are likewise Irish. But though the Irish may justly claim to have nursed Find, or at least to have stood to him in the traditional relationship of God-parents, they cheerfully allow all their tribal connections (and foremost among them the Scotch people) to share the glory of his manhood.</p>
<p>There are other versions of the birth and origin of Find Mac Cumhaill, some of which are noticed in Campbell’s <em>Leabhar na Feinne</em>, vol. I. pp. 33, 34, etc.; but all are of much later date. The most important of these is the tract pubiished by the late Dr O’Donovan, from a fifteenth century Ms., in the <em>Transactions of the Ossianic Society</em>, vol. IV. (Dublin, 1859), on the ” Boyish Exploits of F. m. C. ” Dr O’Donovan, like most other Irish antiquaries, regarded Find Mac Cumhaill as a genuine historical personage, who resided mostly at <em>Almhu</em> in the County of Kildare, but possessed another residence at a place called Magh-Elle (now Moyelly) in the adjoining King’s County. That a person named Find Mac Cumhaill did live at the time indicated (3rd cent.) I do not deny. But it is as certain that his history has degenerated into a pure myth, as that there is now no trace of a dun or fortress on the hill of <em>Almu</em>, or Allen.</p>
<p>In autumn last I had the pleasure of visiting the hill of Allen with Mr. J. F. Campbell, the indefatigable and enlightened coUector of Ossianic legends, and although we were shewn the thicket out of which Find’s hounds, Bran and Sceolán, are still fabled to start nightly, to the alarm of late wayfarers, we could find no trace of such a <em>dun</em> as is referred to in the following tract. The hill is almost a bare rock, on which materials to erect a <em>dun</em> or even a <em>rath</em> are now scarcely obtainable. But beautifuUy situated in the midst of a lovely country, over which it commands a wide prospect, it was well adapted for a place of assembly, or for the chase.</p>
<p>The allusion to Tadg’s command that Find’s mother should be burned is curious. The existence of the practice of burning women for incontinency among the Celts of Britain and Ireland is borne out by other references in ancient tracts. But the discussion of the question hère would extend this note beyond reasonable limits. — W. M. Hennessy.]</p>

<p>Nuadu’s wife, Almu, was entreating that her name might be given to the hill; and that request was granted to her, to wit, that her name should be upon the hill; for it was in it she was buried afterwards; of which was said :</p>

<p>Nuadu had a distinguished son, to wit, Tadhg son of Nuadhu. Rairiu, daughter of Dond-duma, was his wife. A celebrated druid, also, (was) Tadg.</p>

<p>Cumall cornes, however, and takes Murni by force, in elopement with him, since she had not been given to him. Tadg comes to Cond, and relates to him his profanation by Cumall, and he began to incite Cond, and to reproach him.</p>
<p>Cond dispatches messengers to Cumall, and ordered him to leave Ireland, or to restore his daughter to Tadhg. Cumall said he would not give her; but everything he would give, and not the woman. Cond sent his soldiers, and Urgrend son of Lugaid Corr king of Luagni <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*Luagni*,</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">*Luagni</span> <span class="pre">Temrach*.</span> <span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">sept</span> <span class="pre">seated</span> <span class="pre">near</span> <span class="pre">Tara,</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">present</span> <span class="pre">county</span> <span class="pre">Meath.]</span></code>, and Daire Derc son of Eochaid, and his son Aed (who was afterwards called Goll <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*Goll*,</span> <span class="pre">i.</span> <span class="pre">e.</span> <span class="pre">blind.</span> <span class="pre">Vid.</span> <span class="pre">O'Donovan's</span> <span class="pre">suppl.</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">*O'Reilly*,</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">voce.]</span></code>) to attack Cumall. Cumall assembles his army against them; and the battle of Cnucha is fought between them, and Cumall is slain there, and a slaughter of his people is effected.</p>
<p>Cumall fell by Goll son of Morna. Luchet wounded Goll in his eye, so that he destroyed his eye. And hence it is that (the name) “Goll ” attached to him ; whereof was said :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Aed was the name of Daire’s son,<br />
Until Luchet of fame wounded him;<br />
Since the heavy lance wounded him,<br />
Therefore, he has been called Goll.</p>

<p>Goll killed Luchet. It is for that reason, moreover, that a hereditary feud existed between the sons of Morna and Find.</p>
<p>Dairi had two names, to wit, Morna and Dairi.</p>
<p>Murni went, after that, to Cond; for her father rejected her, and did not let her (come) to him, because she was pregnant; and he said to his people to burn her <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*To</span> <span class="pre">burn</span> <span class="pre">her*.</span> <span class="pre">Many</span> <span class="pre">instances</span> <span class="pre">occur</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Irish</span> <span class="pre">taies</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">existence</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">practice</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">burning</span> <span class="pre">women</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">adultery.</span> <span class="pre">In</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">story</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Corc</span> <span class="pre">Mac</span> <span class="pre">Lugdach</span> <span class="pre">(Book</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Leinster,</span> <span class="pre">fol.</span> <span class="pre">206,</span> <span class="pre">a,</span> <span class="pre">2),</span> <span class="pre">we</span> <span class="pre">read,</span> <span class="pre">*Ba</span> <span class="pre">bés</span> <span class="pre">itossaig</span> <span class="pre">nach</span> <span class="pre">ingen</span> <span class="pre">dognid</span> <span class="pre">bais</span> <span class="pre">dar</span> <span class="pre">cenn</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">urnaidm</span> <span class="pre">do</span> <span class="pre">breothad.</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span> <span class="pre">It</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">custom</span> <span class="pre">at</span> <span class="pre">first</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">burn</span> <span class="pre">any</span> <span class="pre">woman</span> <span class="pre">who</span> <span class="pre">committed</span> <span class="pre">lust</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">violation</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">her</span> <span class="pre">compact.]</span></code>. And nevertheless, he dared not (compass) her destruction against Cond.</p>
<p>The girl was asking of Cond how she should act. Cond said: ” Go, ” said he, ” to Fiacal son of Concend, to Temhair-Mairci, and let thy delivery be effected there ” : (for a sister to Cumall was Fiacal’s wife, Bodball Bendron).</p>
<p>Condla, Cond’s servant, went with her, to escort her, until she came to Fiacal’s house, to Temhair-Mairci. Welcome was given to the girl then; and her arrivai there was good. The girl was delivered afterwards, and bare a son; and Demni was given as a name to him.</p>
<p>The boy is nursed by them, after that, until he was capable of committing plunder on every one who was an enemy to him. He then proclaims battle or single combat against Tadg, or else the full <em>eric</em> of his father to be given to him. Tadg said that he would give him judgement therein. The judgement was given; and this is the judgement that was given to him, to wit, that Almu, as it was, should be ceded to him for ever, and Tadg to leave it. It was done so. Tadg abandoned Almu to Find, and came to Tuath-Dathi, to his own hereditary land; and he abode in Cnoc-Réin, which is called Tulach-Taidg <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*Tulach-Taidg*.</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span> <span class="pre">Tadg's</span> <span class="pre">hill.&quot;</span> <span class="pre">The</span> <span class="pre">situation</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">place,</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">must</span> <span class="pre">be</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Meath,</span> <span class="pre">has</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">yet</span> <span class="pre">been</span> <span class="pre">satisfactorily</span> <span class="pre">determined.]</span></code> today; for it is from him it has been called Tulach-Taidg frora that time to this, So that hence was said this :</p>

Because Tadg was not able to sustain battle<br />
