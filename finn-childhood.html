<p>I first came across the tales relating to the childhood of Fionn Mac Cumhaill in James Stephens’ <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/irishfairytales00stepgoog/page/n56/mode/2up"><em>Irish Fairy Tales</em> (1920)</a>.</p>
<p>So what, then, was the childhood of this mighty warrior like?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>He was a king, a seer, and a poet. He was a lord with a manifold and great train. He was our magician, our knowledgeable one, our soothsayer. All that he did was sweet with him. And, however ye deem my testimony of Fionn excessive, and, although ye hold my praising overstrained, nevertheless, and by the King that is above me, he was three times better than all I say.
—Saint Patrick.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>TH story bgins with the death of Uail (Cumhall, “Cool”), Fionn’s father, and the actions of his mother, Muirne, to keep Fionn safe by placing him into the care of two women. Fionn’s early upgringing by them is also described.</p>

<p>THE BOYHOOD OF FIONN</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>FIONN <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Pronounce</span> <span class="pre">Fionn</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">rhyme</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">&quot;tune.&quot;]</span></code> got his first training among women. There is no wonder in that, for it is the pup’s mother teaches it to fight, and women kiiow that fighting is a necessary art although men pretend there are others that are better. These were the women druids, Bovmall and Lia Luachra.</p>
<p>It will be wondered why his own mother did not train him in the first natural savageries of existence, but she could not do it. She could not keep him with her for dread of the clann-Morna. The sons of Morna had been fighting and intriguing for a long time to oust her husband, Uail, from the captaincy of the Fianna of Ireland, and they had ousted him at last by killing him. It was the only way they could get rid of such a man ; but it was not an easy way, for what Fionn’s father did not know in arms could not be taught to him even by Morna. Still, the hound that can wait will catch a hare at last, and even Manannan sleeps.</p>
<p>Fionn’s mother was beautiful, long-haired Muirne: so she is always referred to. She was the daughter of Teigue, the son of Nuada from Faery, and her mother was Ethlinn. That is, her brother was Lugh of the Long Hand himself, and with a god, and such a god, for brother we may marvel that she could have been in dread of Morna or his sons, or of any one. But women have strange loves, strange fears, and these are so boimd up with one another that the thing which is presented to us is not often the thing that is to be seen.</p>
<p>However it may be, when Uail died, Muirne got married again to the King of Kerry. She gave the child to Bovmall and Lia Luachra to rear, and we may be sure that she gave injunctions with him, and many of them. The yoimgster was brought to the woods of Slieve Bloom and was nursed there in secret.</p>
<p>It is likely the women were fond of him, for other than Fionn there was no life about them. He would be their life; and their eyes may have seemed as twin benedictions resting on the small fair head. He was fair-haired, and it was for his fairness that he was afterwards called Fionn; but at this period he was known as Deimne. They saw the food they put into his little frame reproduce itself lengthways and sideways in tough inches, and in springs and energies that crawled at first, and then toddled, and then ran. He had birds for playmates, but all the creatures that live in a wood must have been his comrades. There would have been for little Fionn long hours of lonely sunshine, when the world seemed just sunshine and a sky. There would have been hours as long, when existence passed like a shade among shadows, in the multitudinous tappings of rain that dripped from leaf to leaf in the wood, and slipped so to the ground. He would have known little snaky paths, narrow enough to be filled by his own small feet, or a goat’s; and he would have wondered where they went, and have marvelled again to find that, wherever They went, they came at last, through loops and twists of the branchy wood, to his own door. He may have thought of his own door as the beginning and end of the world, whence all things went, and whither all things came.</p>
<p>Perhaps he did not see the lark for a long time, but he would have heard him, far out of sight in the endless sky, thrilling and thrilling imtil the world seemed to have no other soimd but that clear sweetness; and what a world it was to make that sound! Whistles and chirps; cooes and caws and croaks, would have grown familiar to him. And he could at last have told which brother of the great brotherhood was making the noise he heard at any moment. The wind too: he would have listened to its thousand voices as it moved in all seasons and in all moods. Perhaps a horse would stray into the thick screen about his home, and would look as solemnly on Fionn as Fionn did on it. Or, coming suddenly on him, the horse might stare, all a-cock with eyes and ears and nose, one long-drawn facial extension, ere he turned and bounded away with manes all over him and hoofs all under him and tails all round him. A solemn-nosed, stern-eyed cow would amble and stamp in his wood to find a flyless shadow; or a strayed sheep would poke its gentle muzzle through leaves.</p>
<p>“A boy,” he might think, as he stared on a staring horse, “a boy cannot wag his tail to keep the flies off,” and that lack may have saddened him. He may have thought that a cow can snort and be dignified at the one moment, and that timidity is comely in a sheep. He would have scolded the jackdaw, and tried to out-whistle the throstle, and wondered why his pipe got tired when the blackbird’s didn’t.</p>
<p>There would be flies to be watched, slender atoms in yellow gauze that flew, and filmy specks that flittered, and sturdy, thick-ribbed brutes that pounced like cats and bit like dogs and flew like lightning.</p>
<p>He may have mourned for the spider in bad-luck who caught that fly.</p>
<p>There would be much to see and remember and compare, and there would be, always, his two guardians. The flies change from second to second ; one cannot tell if this bird is a visitor or an inhabitant, and a sheep is just sister to a sheep; but the women were as rooted as the house itself.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>Were his nurses comely or harsh-looking? Fionn would not know. This was the one who picked him up when he fell, and that was the one who patted the bruise. This one said :</p>
<p>“Mind you do not tumble in the well!”</p>
<p>And that one :</p>
<p>“Mind the little knees among the nettles.”</p>
<p>But he did tumble and record that the only notable thing about a well is that it is wet. And as for nettles, if they hit him he hit back. He slashed into them with a stick and brought them low.</p>
<p>There was nothing in wells or nettles, only women dreaded them. One patronised women and instructed them and comforted them, for they were afraid about one.</p>
<p>They thought that one should not climb a tree !</p>
<p>“Next week,” they said at last, “you may climb this one,” and “next week” lived at the end of the world !</p>
<p>But the tree that was climbed was not worth while when it had been climbed twice. There was a bigger one near by. There were trees that no one could climb, with vast shadow on one side and vaster sunshine on the other. It took a long time to walk round them, and you could not see their tops.</p>
<p>It was pleasant to stand on a branch that swayed and sprang, and it was good to stare at an impenetrable roof of leaves and then climb into it. How wonderful the loneliness was up there ! When he looked down there was an undulating floor of leaves, green and green and greener to a very blackness of greeniness; and when he looked up there were leaves again, green and less green and not green at all, up to a very snow and blindness of greeniness; and above and below and around there was sway and motion, the whisper of leaf on leaf, and the eternal silence to which one listened and at which one tried to look.</p>
<p>When he was six years of age his mother, beautiful, long-haired Muirne, came to see him. She came secretly, for she feared the sons of Morna, and she had paced through lonely places in many coimties before she reached the hut in the wood, and the cot where he lay with his fists shut and sleep gripped in them.</p>
<p>He awakened to be sure. He would have one ear that would catch an unusual voice, one eye that would open, however sleepy the other one was. She took him in her arms and kissed him, and she sang a sleepy song until the small boy slept again.</p>
<p>We may be sure that the eye that could stay open stayed open that night as long as it could, and that the one ear listened to the sleepy song until the song got too low to be heard, imtil it was too tender to be felt vibrating along those soft arms, until Fionn was asleep again, with a new picture in his little head and a new notion to ponder on.</p>
<p>The mother of himself ! His own mother !</p>
<p>But when he awakened she was gone.</p>
<p>She was going back secretly, in dread of the sons of Morna, slipping through gloomy woods, keeping away from habitations, getting by desolate and lonely ways to her lord in Kerry.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was he that was afraid of the sons of Morna, and perhaps she loved him.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>The women druids, his guardians, belonged to his father’s people. Bovmall was Uail’s sister, and, consequently, Fionn’s aunt. Only such a blood-tie could have bound them to the clann-Baiscne, for it is not easy, having moved in the world of court and camp, to go hide with a baby in a wood ; and to live, as they must have lived, in terror.</p>
<p>What stories they would have told the child of the sons of Morna. Of Morna himself, the huge-shouldered, stem-eyed, violent Connachtman; and of his sons — young Goll Mor mac Morna in particular, as huge-shouldered as his father, as fierce in the onset, but merry-eyed when the other was grim, and bubbling with a laughter that made men forgive even his butcheries. Of Conán Mael mac Morna his brother, gruff as a badger, bearded like a boar, bald as a crow, and with a tongue that could manage an insult where another man would not find even a stammer. His boast was that when he saw an open door he went into it, and when he saw a closed door he went into it. When he saw a peaceful man he insulted him, and when he met a man who was not peaceful he insulted him. There was Garra Duv mac Morna, and savage Art Og, who cared as little for their own skins as they did for the next lean’s, and Garra must have been rough indeed to have earned in that clan the name of the Rough mac Morna. There were others : wild Connachtmen all, as untamable, as unaccountable as their own wonderful countryside.</p>
<p>Fionn would have heard much of them, and it is likely that he practised on a nettle at taking the head off Goll, and that he hunted a sheep from cover in the implacable manner he intended later on for Conan the Swearer.</p>
<p>But it is of Uail mac Baiscne he would have heard most.</p>
<p>With what a dilation of spirits the ladies would have told tales of him, Fionn’s father. How their voices would have become a chant as feat was added to feat, glory piled on glory. The most famous of men and the most beautiful; the hardest fighter; the easiest giver; the kingly champion; the chief of the Fianna na h-Eirinn. Tales of how he had been waylaid and got free; of how he had been generous and got free; of how he had been angry and went marchmg with the speed of an eagle and the direct onfall of a storm ; while in front and at the sides, angled from the prow of his terrific advance, were fleeing multitudes who did not dare to wait and scarce had time to run. And of how at last, when the time came to quell him, nothing less than the whole might of Ireland was sufficient for that great downfall.</p>
<p>We may be sure that on these adventures Fionn was with his father, going step for step with the long-striding hero, and heartening him mightily.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>He was given good training by the women in running and leaping and swimming. One of them would take a thorn switch in her hand, and Fionn would take a thorn switch in his hand, and each would try to strike the other running round a tree.</p>
<p>You had to go fast to keep away from the switch behind, and a small boy feels a switch. Fionn would nm his best to get away from that prickly stinger, but how he would run when it was his turn to deal the strokes !</p>
<p>With reason too, for his nurses had suddenly grown implacable. They pursued him with a savagery which he could not distinguish from hatred, and they swished him well whenever they got the chance.</p>
<p>Fionn learned to run. After a while he could buzz around a tree like a maddened fly, and oh, the joy, when he felt himself drawing from the switch and gaining from behind on its bearer ! How he strained and panted to catch on that pursuing person and pursue her and get his own switch into action.</p>
<p>He learned to jump by chasing hares in a bumpy field. Up went the hare and up went Fionn, and away with the two of them, hopping and popping across the field. If the hare turned while Fionn was after her it was switch for Fionn; so that in a while it did not matter to Fionn which way the hare jumped, for he could jump that way too. Longways, sideways, or baw-ways, Fionn hopped where the hare hopped, and at last he was the owner of a hop that any hare would give an ear for.</p>
<p>He was taught to swim, and it may be that his heart sank when he fronted the lesson. The water was cold. It was deep. One could see the bottom, leagues below, millions of miles below. A small boy might shiver as he stared into that wink and blink and twink of brown pebbles and murder. And these implacable women threw him in!</p>
<p>Perhaps he would not go in at first. He may have smiled at them, and coaxed, and hung back. It was a leg and an arm gripped then; a swing for Fionn, and out and away with him ; plop and flop for him ; down into chill deep death for him, and up with a splutter; with a sob; with a grasp at everything that caught nothing; with a wild flurry; with a raging despair; with a bubble and snort as he was hauled again down, and down, and down, and found as suddenly that he had been hauled out.</p>
<p>Fionn learned to swim until he could pop into the water like an otter and slide through it like an eel.</p>
<p>He used to try to chase a fish the way he chased hares in the bumpy field — but there are terrible spurts in a fish. It may be that a fish cannot hop, but he gets there in a flash, and he isn’t there in another. Up or down, sideways or endways, it is all one to a fish. He goes and is gone. He twists this way and disappears the other way. He is over you when he ought to be under you, and he is biting your toe when you thought you were biting his tail.</p>
<p>You cannot catch a fish by swimming, but you can try, and Fionn tried. He got a grudging commendation from the terrible women when he was able to slip noiselessly in the tide, swim under water to where a wild duck was floating, and grip it by the leg.</p>
<p>“Qu — ,” said the duck, and he disappeared before he had time to get the “-ack” out of him.</p>
<p>So the time went, and Fionn grew long and straight and tough like a sapling; limber as a willow, and with the flirt and spring of a young bird. One of the ladies may have said, “He is shaping very well, my dear,” and the other replied, as is the morose privilege of an aunt, “He will never be as good as his father,” but their hearts must have overflowed in the night, in the silence, in the darkness, when they thought of the living swiftness they had fashioned, and that dear, fair head.</p>

<p>With Fionn’s location discovered by the clan Morna, who had killed Fionn’s father, it was time for the boy to lave his childhood home.</p>

<p>THE BOYHOOD OF FIONN</p>
<p>pp.48-52</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>One day his guardians were agitated: they held confabulations at which Fionn was not permitted to assist. A man who passed by in the morning had spoken to them. They fed the man, and during his feeding Fionn had been shooed from the door as if he were a chicken. When the stranger took his road the women went with him a short distance. As they passed the man lifted a hand and bent a knee to Fionn.</p>
<p>“My soul to you, young master,” he said, and as he said it, Fionn knew that he could have the man’s soul, or his boots, or his feet, or anything that belonged to him.</p>
<p>When the women returned they were mysterious and whispery. They chased Fionn into the house, and when they got him in they chased him out again. They chased each other around the house for another whisper. They calculated things by the shape of clouds, by lengths of shadows, by the flight of birds, by two flies racing on a flat stone, by throwing bones over their left shoulders, and by every kind of trick and game and chance that you could put a mind to.</p>
<p>They told Fionn he must sleep in a tree that night, and they put him under bonds not to sing or whistle or cough or sneeze until the morning.</p>
<p>Fionn did sneeze. He never sneezed so much in his life. He sat up in his tree and nearly sneezed himself out of it. Flies got up his nose, two at a time, one up each nose, and his head nearly fell off the way he sneezed.</p>
<p>“You are doing that on purpose,” said a savage whisper from the foot of the tree.</p>
<p>But Fionn was not doing it on purpose. He tucked himself into a fork the way he had been taught, and he passed the crawliest, tickliest night he had ever known. After a while he did not want to sneeze, he wanted to scream; and in particular he wanted to come down from the tree. But he did not scream, nor did he leave the tree. His word was passed, and he stayed in his tree as silent as a mouse and as watchful, until he fell out of it.</p>
<p>In the morning a band of travelling poets were passing, and the women handed Fionn over to them. This time they could not prevent him overhearing.</p>
<p>“The sons of Morna!” they said.</p>
<p>And Fionn’s heart might have swelled with rage, but that it was already swollen with adventure. And also the expected was happening. Behind every hour of their day and every moment of their lives lay the sons of Morna. Fionn had run after them as deer: he jumped after them as hares: he dived after them as fish. They lived in the house with him : they sat at the table and ate his meat. One dreamed of them, and they were expected in the morning as the sun is. They knew only too well that the son of Uail was living, and they knew that their own sons would know no case while that son lived; for they believed in those days that like breeds like, and that the son of Uail would be Uail with additions.</p>
<p>His guardians knew that their hidingplace must at last be discovered, and that, when it was found, the sons of Morna would come. They had no doubt of that, and every action of their lives was based on that certainty. For no secret can remain secret. Some broken soldier tramping home to his people will find it out; a herd seeking his strayed cattle or a band of travelling musicians will get the wind of it. How many people will move through even the remotest wood in a year ! The crows will tell a secret if no one else does ; and under a bush, behind a clump of bracken, what eyes may there not be ! But if your secret is legged like a young goat ! If it is tongued like a wolf ! One can hide a baby, but you cannot hide a boy. He will rove unless you tie him to a post, and he will whistle then.</p>
<p>The sons of Morna came, but there were only two grim women living in a lonely hut to greet them. We may be sure they were well greeted. One can imagine Goll’s merry stare taking in all that could be seen; Conan’s grim eye raking the women’s faces while his tongue raked them again; the Rough mac Morna shouldering here and there in the house and about it, with maybe a hatchet in his hand, and Art Og coursing farther afield and vowing that if the cub was there he would find him.</p>
</div>
<p>Fionn joins a band of poets, and thn a band of robbers, led by one who was in the Fianna under Fionn’s father.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Boyhood of Fion, Chapters VI-VII, Stephens, 1920</p>
<p>THE BOYHOOD OF FIONN</p>
<p>pp.52-60</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>But Fionn was gone. He was away, bound with his band of poets for the Galtees.</p>
<p>It is likely they were junior poets come to the end of a year’s training, and returning to their own province to see again the people at home, and to be wondered at and exclaimed at as they exhibited bits of the knowledge which they had brought from the great schools. They would know tags of rhyme and tricks about learning which Fionn would hear of; and now and again, as they rested in a glade or by the brink of a river, they might try their lessons over. They might even refer to the ogham wands on which the first words of their tasks and the opening lines of poems were cut ; and it is likely that, being new to these things, they would talk of them to a youngster, and, thinking that his wits could be no better than their own, they might have explained to him how ogham was written. But it is far more likely that his women guardians had already started him at those lessons.</p>
<p>Still this band of young bards would have been of infinite interest to Fionn, not on account of what they had leamed, but because of what they knew. All the things that he should have known as by nature: the look, the movement, the feeling of crowds; the shouldering and intercourse of man with man; the clustering of houses and how people bore themselves in and about them ; the movement of armed men, and the home-coming look of wounds ; tales of births, and marriages, and deaths ; the chase with its multitudes of men and dogs; all the noise, the dust, the excitement of mere living. These, to Fionn, new come from leaves and shadows and the dipple and dapple of a wood, would have seemed wonderful; and the tales they would have told of their masters, their looks, fads, severities, sillinesses, would have been wonderful also.</p>
<p>That band should have chattered like a rookery.</p>
<p>They must have been young, for one time a Leinsterman came on them, a great robber named Fiacuil mac Cona, and he killed the poets. He chopped them up and chopped them down. He did not leave one poeteen of them all. He put them out of the world and out of life, so that they stopped being, and no one could tell where they went or what had really happened to them; and it is a wonder indeed that one can do that to anything let alone a band. If they were not youngsters, the bold Fiacuil could not have managed them all. Or, perhaps, he too had a band, although the record does not say so; but kill them he did, and they died that way.</p>
<p>Fionn saw that deed, and his blood may have been cold enough as he watched the great robber coursing the poets as a wild dog rages in a flock. And when his turn came, when they were all dead, and the grim, redhanded man trod at him, Fionn may have shivered, but he would have shown his teeth and laid roundly on the monster with his hands. Perhaps he did that, and perhaps for that he was spared.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” roared the staring blackmouth with the red tongue squirming in it like a frisky fish.</p>
<p>“The son of Uail, son of Baiscne,” quoth hardy Fionn.</p>
<p>And at that the robber ceased to be a robber, the murderer disappeared, the blackrimmed chasm packed with red fish and precipices changed to something else, and the round eyes that had been popping out of their sockets and trying to bite, changed also. There remained a laughing and crying and loving servant who wanted to tie himself into knots if that would please the son of his great captain. Fionn went home on the robber’s shoulder, and the robber gave great snorts and made great jumps and behaved like a first-rate horse. For this same Fiacuil was the husband of Bovmall, Fionn’s aunt. He had taken to the wilds when clann-Baiscne was broken, and he was at war with a world that had dared to kill his Chief.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>A NEW life for Fionn in the robber’s den that was hidden in a vast cold marsh.</p>
<p>A tricky place that would be, with sudden exits and even suddener entrances, and with damp, winding, spidery places to hoard treasure in, or to hide oneself in.</p>
<p>If the robber was a solitary he would, for lack of some one else, have talked greatly to Fionn. He would have shown his weapons and demonstrated how he used them, and with what slash he chipped his victim, and with what slice he chopped him. He would have told why slash was enough for this man and why that man should be sliced. All men are masters when one is yoimg, and Fionn would have found knowledge here also. He would have seen Fiacuil’s great spear that had thirty rivets of Arabian gold in its socket, and that had to be kept wrapped up and tied down so that it would not kill people out of mere spitefulness. It had come from Faery, out of the Shi of Aillen mac Midna, and it would be brought back again later on between the same man’s shoulder-blades.</p>
<p>What tales that man could tell a boy, and what questions a boy could ask him. He would have known a thousand tricks, and because our instinct is to teach, and because no man can keep a trick from a boy, he would show them to Fionn.</p>
<p>There was a marsh too; a whole new life to be learned; a complicated, mysterious, dank, slippery, reedy, treacherous life, but with its own beauty and an allurement that could grow on one, so that you could forget the solid world and love only that which quaked and gurgled.</p>
<p>In this place you may swim. By this sign and this you will know if it is safe to do so, said Fiacuil mac Cona; but in this place, with this sign on it and that, you must not venture a toe.</p>
<p>But where Fionn would venture his toes his ears would follow.</p>
<p>There are coiling weeds down there, the robber counselled him ; there are thin, tough, snaky binders that will trip you and grip you, that will pull you and will not let you go again imtil you are drowned; until you are swaying and swinging away below, with outstretched arms, with outstretched legs, with a face all stares and smiles and jockeying, gripped in those leathery arms, until there is no more to be gripped of you even by them.</p>
<p>“Watch these and this and that/’ Fionn would have been told, “and always swim with a knife in your teeth.”</p>
<p>He lived there until his guardians foimd out where he was and came after him. Fiacuil gave him up to them, and he was brought home again to the woods of Slieve Bloom, but he had gathered great knowledge and new supplenesses.</p>
<p>The sons of Morna left him alone for a long time. Having made their essay they grew careless.</p>
<p>“Let him be,” they said. “He will come to us when the time comes.”</p>
<p>But it is likely too that they had had their own means of getting information about him. How he shaped? what muscles he had ? and did he spring clean from the mark or had he to get off with a push ?</p>
<p>Fionn stayed with his guardians and hunted for them. He could run a deer down and haul it home by the reluctant skull. “Come on, Goll,” he would say to his stag, or, lifting it over a tussock with a tough grip on the snout, “Are you coming, bald Conan, or shall I kick you in the neck?”</p>
<p>The time must have been nigh when he would think of taking the world itself by the nose, to haul it over tussocks and drag it into his pen; for he was of the breed in whom mastery is bom, and who are good masters.</p>
<p>But reports of his prowess were getting abroad. Clann-Morna began to stretch itself uneasily, and, one day, his guardians sent him on his travels.</p>
<p>“It is best for you to leave us now,” they said to the tall stripling, “for the sons of Morna are watching again to kill you.”</p>
<p>The woods at that may have seemed haunted. A stone might sling at one from a tree-top; but from which tree of a thousand trees did it come? An arrow buzzing by one’s ear would slide into the ground and quiver there silently, menacingly, hinting of die brothers it had left in the quiver behind ; to the right? to the left? how many brothers? in how many quivers…? Fionn was a woodsman, but he had only two eyes to look with, one set of feet to carry him in cme sole direction. But when he was looking to the front, what, or how many whats, could be staring at him from the back? He might face in this direction, away from, or towards a smile on a hidden face and a finger on a string. A lance might slide at him from this bush or from the one yonder. … In the night he might have fought them; his ears against theirs; his noiseless feet against their lurking ones; his knowledge of the wood against their legion: but during the day he had no chance.</p>
<p>Fionn went to seek his fortune, to match himself against all that might happen, and to carve a name for himself that will live while Time has an ear and knows an Irishman.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Boyhood of Fion, Chapter VIII, Stephens, 1920</p>
<p>THE BOYHOOD OF FIONN</p>
<p>pp.60-67</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>FIONN went away, and now he was alone. But he was as fitted for loneliness as the crane is that haunts the solitudes and bleak wastes of the sea; for the man with a thought has a comrade, and Fionn’s mind worked as featly as his body did. To be alone was no trouble to him who, however surrounded, was to be lonely his life long; for this will be said of Fionn when all is said, that all that came to him went from him, and that happiness was never his companion for more than a moment.</p>
<p>But he was not now looking for loneliness. He was seeking the instruction of a crowd, and therefore when he met a crowd he went into it. His eyes were skilled to observe in the moving dusk and dapple of green woods. They were trained to pick out of shadows birds that were themselves dun-coloured shades, and to see among trees the animals that are coloured like the bark of trees. The hare crouching in the fronds was visible to him, and the fish that swayed invisibly in the sway and flicker of a green bank. He would see all that was to be seen, and he would see all that is passed by the eye that is half blind from use and wont.</p>
<p>At Moy Life he came on lads swimming in a pool ; and, as he looked on them sporting in the flush tide, he thought that the tricks they performed were not hard for him, and that he could have shown them new ones.</p>
<p>Boys must know what another boy can do, and they will match themselves against everything. They did their best under these observing eyes, and it was not long until he was invited to compete with them and show his mettle. Such an invitation is a challenge; it is almost, among boys, a declaration of war. But Fionn was so far beyond them in swimming that even the word master did not apply to that superiority.</p>
<p>While he was swimming one remarked: “He is fair and well shaped,” and thereafter he was called “Fionn” or the Fair One. His name came from boys, and will, perhaps, be preserved by them.</p>
<p>He stayed with these lads for some time, and it may be that they idolised him at first, for it is the way with boys to be astounded and enraptured by feats ; but in the end, and that was inevitable, they grew jealous of the stranger. Those who had been the champions before he came would marshal each other, and, by social pressure, would muster all the others against him ; so that in the end not a friendly eye was turned on Fionn in that assembly. For not only did he beat them at swimming, he beat their best at running and jumping, and when the sport degenerated into violence, as it was bound to, the roughness of Fionn would be ten times as rough as the roughness of the roughest rough they could put forward. Bravery is pride when one is young, and Fionn was proud.</p>
<p>There must have been anger in his mind as he went away leaving that lake behind him, and those snarling and scowling boys, but there would have been disappointment also, for his desire at this time should have been towards friendliness.</p>
<p>He went thence to Lock Lein and took service with the King of Finntraigh. That kingdom may have been thus called from Fionn himself and would have been known by another name when he arrived there.</p>
<p>He hunted for the King of Finntraigh, and it soon grew evident that there was no hunter in his service to equal Fionn. More, there was no hunter of them all who even distantly approached him in excellence. The others ran after deer, using the speed of their legs, the noses of their dogs, and a thousand well-worn tricks to bring them within reach, and, often enough, the animal escaped them. But the deer that Fionn got the track of did not get away, and it seemed even that the animals sought him, so many did he catch.</p>
<p>The king marvelled at the stories that were told of this new hunter, but as kings are greater than other people so they are more curious; and, being on the plane of excellence, they must see all that is excellently told of.</p>
<p>The king wished to see him, and Fionn must have wondered what the king thought as that gracious lord looked on him. Whatever was thought, what the king said was as direct in utterance as it was in observation.</p>
<p>“If Uail the son of Baiscne has a son,” said the king, “you would surely be that son.”</p>
<p>We are not told if the King of Finntraigh said anything more, but we know that Fionn left his service soon afterwards.</p>
<p>He went southwards and was next in the employment of the King of Kerry, the same lord who had married his own mother. In that service he came to such consideration that we hear of him as playing a match of chess with the king, and by this game we know that he was still a boy in his mind however mightily his limbs were spreading. Able as he was in sports and himtings, he was yet too young to be politic, but he remained impolitic to the end of his days, for whatever he was able to do he would do, no matter who was offended thereat; and whatever he was not able to do he would do also.</p>
<p>That was Fionn.</p>
</div>
<p>The narrative then diverges slightly with an example of Fionn’s character from later in his lif:</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The Character of Fionn</p>
<p>Once, as they rested on a chase, a debate arose among the Fianna-Finn as to what was the finest music in the world.</p>
<p>“Tell us that,” said Fionn, turning to Oisin. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Pronounced</span> <span class="pre">Usheen.]</span></code></p>
<p>“The cuckoo calling from the tree that is highest in the hedge,” cried his merry son.</p>
<p>“A good sound,” said Fionn. “And you, Oscar,” he asked, “what is to your mind the finest of music?”</p>
<p>“The top of music is the ring of a spear on a shield,” cried the stout lad.</p>
<p>“It is a good sound,” said Fionn.</p>
<p>And the other champions told their delight : the belling of a stag across water, the baying of a timeful pack heard in the distance, the song of a lark, the laugh of a gleeful girl, or the whisper of a moved one.</p>
<p>“They are good sounds all,” said Fionn.</p>
<p>“Tell us, chief,” one ventured, “what you think?”</p>
<p>“The music of what happens,” said great Fionn, “that is the finest music in the world.”</p>
</div>
<p>This aside provides some context for another example of Fioon’s character, as he plays chess with the King.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Playing Chess with the King</p>
<p><em>continues</em></p>
<p>He loved “what happened,” and would not evade it by the swerve of a hair; so on this occasion what was occurring he would have occur, although a king was his rival and his master. It may be that his mother was watching the match and that he could not but exhibit his skill before her. He committed the enormity of winning seven games in succession from the king himself !!!</p>
<p>It is seldom indeed that a subject can beat a king at chess, and this monarch was properly amazed.</p>
<p>“Who are you at all?” he cried, starting back from the chessboard and staring on Fionn.</p>
<p>“I am the son of a countryman of the Luigne of Tara,” said Fionn.</p>
<p>He may have blushed as he said it, for the king, possibly for the first time, was really looking at him, and was looking back through twenty years of time as he did so. The observation of a king is faultless — it is proved a thousand times over in the tales, and this king’s equipment was as royal as the next.</p>
<p>“You are no such son,” said the indignant monarch, “but you are the son that Muirne my wife bore to Uail mac Baiscne.”</p>
<p>And at that Fionn had no more to say; but his eyes may have flown to his mother and stayed there.</p>
<p>“You cannot remain here,” his stepfather continued. “I do not want you killed under my protection,” he explained, or complained.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was on Fionn’s account he dreaded the sons of Morna, but no one knows what Fionn thought of him for he never thereafter spoke of his stepfather. As for Muirne she must have loved her lord ; or she may have been terrified in truth of the sons of Morna and for Fionn; but it is so also, that if a woman loves her second husband she can dislike all that reminds her of the first one.</p>
<p>Fionn went on his travels again.</p>
</div>
<p>Steven’s tale then continues with Fionn apprenticing himself to the poet Finegas, and eating the Salmon of Knowledge, but that is a tale for a later chapter.</p>
<p>For now, let us turn to a version of Fionn’s boyhood that appears as translation by Lady Gregory in her collection “Gods and Fighting Men”, published in 1904:</p>

<p>PART TWO: THE FIANNA.</p>
<p>BOOK ONE : FINN, SON OF CUMHAL.</p>
<p>CHAPTER I. THE COMING OF FINN</p>
<p>AT the time Finn was born his father Cumhal, of the sons of Baiscne, Head of the Fianna of Ireland, had been killed in battle by the sons of Morna that were fighting with him for the leadership. And his mother, that was beautiful long-haired Muirne, daughter of Tadg, son of Nuada of the Tuatha de Danaan and of Ethlinn, mother of Lugh of the Long Hand, did not dare to keep him with her ; and two women, Bodhmall, the woman Druid, and Liath Luachra, came and brought him away to care him.</p>
<p>It was to the woods of Slieve Bladhma they brought him, and they nursed him secretly, because of his father’s enemies, the sons of Morna, and they kept him there a long time.</p>
<p>And Muirne, his mother, took another husband that was king of Carraighe ; but at the end of six years she came to see Finn, going through every lonely place till she came to the wood, and there she found the little hunting cabin, and the boy asleep in it, and she lifted him up in her arms and kissed him, and she sang a little sleepy song to him ; and then she said farewell to the women, and she went away again.</p>
<p>And the two women went on caring him till he came to sensible years ; and one day when he went out he saw a wild duck on the lake with her clutch, and he made a cast at her that cut the wings off her that she could not fly, and he brought her back to the cabin, and that was his first hunt.</p>
<p>And they gave him good training in running and leaping and swimming. One of them would run round a tree, and she having a thorn switch, and Finn after her with another switch, and each one trying to hit at the other ; and they would leave him in a field, and hares along with him, and would bid him not to let the hares quit the field, but to keep before them whichever way they would go ; and to teach him swimming they would throw him into the water and let him make his way out.</p>
<p>But after a while he went away with a troop of poets, to hide from the sons of Morna, and they hid him in the mountain of Crotta Cliach ; but there was a robber in Leinster at that time, Fiacuil, son of Codhna, and he came where the poets were in Fidh Gaible and killed them all. But he spared the child and brought him to his own house, that was in a cold marsh. But the two women, Bodhmall and Liath, came looking for him after a while, and Fiacuil gave him up to them, and they brought him back to the same place he was before.</p>
<p>He grew up there, straight and strong and fair-haired and beautiful. And one day he was out in Slieve Bladhma, and the two women along with him, and they saw before them a herd of the wild deer of the mountain. ” It is a pity,” said the old woman, “we not to be able to get a deer of those deer.” ” I will get one for you,” said Finn ; and with that he followed after them, and caught two stags of them and brought them home to the hunting cabin. And after that he used to be hunting for them every day. But at last they said to him : ” It is best for you to leave us now, for the sons of Morna are watching again to kill you.”</p>
<p>So he went away then by himself, and never stopped till he came to Magh Life, and there he saw young lads swimming in a lake, and they called to him to swim against them. So he went into the lake, and he beat them at swimming. ” Fair he is and well shaped,” they said when they saw him swimming, and it was from that time he got the name of Finn, that is, Fair. But they got to be jealous of his strength, and he went away and left them.</p>
<p>He went on then till he came to Loch Lein, and he took service there with the King of Finntraigh ; and there was no hunter like him, and the king said: “If Cumhal had left a son, you would be that son.”</p>
<p>He went from that king after, and he went into Carraighe, and there he took service with the king, that had taken his mother Muirne for his wife. And one day they were playing chess together, and he won seven games one after another. ” Who are you at all ? ” said the king then. ” I am a son of a countryman of the Luigne of Teamhair,” said Finn. ” That is not so,” said the king, “but you are the son that Muirne my wife bore to Cumhal. And do not stop here any longer,” he said, ” that you may not be killed under my protection.”</p>
<p>From that he went into Connacht looking for his father’s brother, Crimall, son of Trenmor ; and as he was going on his way he heard the crying of a lone woman. He went to her, and looked at her, and tears of blood were on her face. ” Your face is red with blood, woman,” he said. ” I have reason for it,” said she, ” for my only son is after being killed by a great fighting man that came on us.” And Finn followed after the big champion and fought with him and killed him. And the man he killed was the same man that had given Cumhal his first wound in the battle where he got his death, and had brought away his treasure-bag with him.</p>
<p>Now as to that treasure-bag, it is of a crane skin it was made, that was one time the skin of Aoife, the beautiful sweetheart of Ilbrec, son of Manannan, that was put into the shape of a crane through jealousy. And it was in Manannan’s house it used to be, and there were treasures kept in it, Manannan’s shirt and his knife, and the belt and the smith’s hook of Goibniu, and the shears of the King of Alban, and the helmet of the King of Lochlann, and a belt of the skin of a great fish, and the bones of Asal’s pig that had been brought to Ireland by the sons of Tuireann. And the bag went from Manannan to Lugh, son of Ethlinn, and after that to Cumhal, that was husband to Muirne, Ethlinn’s daughter.</p>
<p>And Finn took the treasure-bag and brought it with him till he found Crimall, that was now an old man, living in a lonely place, and some of the old men of the Fianna were with him, and used to go hunting for him. And Finn gave him the treasure-bag, and told him his whole story.</p>
<p><em>[And then he said farewell to Crimall, and went on to learn poetry from Finegas, a poet that was living at the Boinn]</em></p>

<li><p>THERE befell a meeting of valour and a contest of battle about the chieftaincy of the <em>fian</em> and about the high-stewardship of Ireland between Cumall, son of Tr6nm6r, and Urgriu, son of Lugaid Corr of the Luaigni. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[A</span> <span class="pre">famous</span> <span class="pre">military</span> <span class="pre">sept</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Meath,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> That Cumall was of the Corco Oche of Cuil Contuind, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;A</span> <span class="pre">territory</span> <span class="pre">situated</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">borders</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">present</span> <span class="pre">counties</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Meath</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Cavan,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> for to these the Ui Tairrsig, Cumall’s tribe, belonged.

<li><p>Then the battle of Cnucha [<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Now</span> <span class="pre">Castleknock,</span> <span class="pre">near</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Liffey,</span> <span class="pre">Co.</span> <span class="pre">Dublin.]</span></code> was fought between them, to wit, between Cumall and Urgriu. Daire the Red, son of Echaid the Fair, son of Coirpre the Valorous, son of Muiredach, and his son Aed were fighting the battle along with Urgriu. Another name for that Daire was Morna Wryneck. So the battle was fought. Luchet and Aed, son of Morna, met in the battle. Luchet wounded Aed, and destroyed one of his eyes, whence the name of Goll (ix. the One-eyed) clave to him from that time forth. Luchet fell by Goll. The man who kept Cumall’s treasure-bag wounded Cumall in the battle. Cumall fell in the battle by Goll, son of Morna, who carried off his spoils and his head, whence there was a hereditary feud between Finn and the sons of Morna.</p></li>

<li><p>Cumall left his wife Muirne pregnant. And she brings forth a son, to whom the name of Demne was given. Fiacail, son of Conchenn, and Bodbmall the druidess, and the Grey one of Luachair came to Muirne, and carry away the boy, for his mother durst not let him be with her. Muirne afterwards slept with Gleor Red-hand, king of the Lamraige, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;</span> <span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">people</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Kerry,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> whence* the saying, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Read</span> <span class="pre">*conid</span> <span class="pre">[d]eiside*.]</span></code> ‘ Finn, son of Gleor.’ Bodbmall, however, and the Grey one, and the boy with them, went into the forest of Slieve Bloom. There the boy was secretly reared That was indeed necessary, for many a sturdy stalwart youth, and many a venomous hostile warrior and angry fierce champion of the warriors of the Luaigni and of the sons of Morna were lying in wait for that boy, and for Tulcha, the son of Cumall. In that manner then those two women-warriors reared him for a long time.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, at the end of six years, his mother came to visit her son, for she had been told that he was in that place, and besides, she was afraid of the sons of Morna for him. However, she passed from one wilderness to another, until she reached the forest of Slieve Bloom. She found the hunting-booth and the boy asleep in it. And then she lifts the boy to her bosom, and presses him to her, and she pregnant at the time. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">Irish</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">*ocus</span> <span class="pre">si</span> <span class="pre">irom</span> <span class="pre">iarum*</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">should</span> <span class="pre">not,</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">think,</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">has</span> <span class="pre">been</span> <span class="pre">suggested,</span> <span class="pre">be</span> <span class="pre">rendered</span> <span class="pre">'</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">she</span> <span class="pre">pregnant</span> <span class="pre">thereafter,'</span> <span class="pre">*iarum*</span> <span class="pre">here</span> <span class="pre">having</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">force</span> <span class="pre">oi</span> <span class="pre">*tra*</span> <span class="pre">(see</span> <span class="pre">Windisch,</span> <span class="pre">Wörterbuch,</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">613)</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">*iarsin*.</span> <span class="pre">Besides,</span> <span class="pre">*ocus</span> <span class="pre">si*</span> <span class="pre">denotes</span> <span class="pre">an</span> <span class="pre">accompanying</span> <span class="pre">circumstance.]</span></code> It was then she made the quatrains, fondling her son : —</p></li>

<ol class="simple">
<li><p>On a certain day the boy went out alone, and saw ducks upon a lake. He sent a shot among them, which cut off the feathers and wings of one, so that a trance fell upon her ; and then he seized her and took her with him to the hunting-booth. And that was Finn’s first chase.</p></li>
<li><p>He afterwards went with certain <em>cairds</em> to flee from the sons of Morna, and was with them about Crotta. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;i.e.</span> <span class="pre">Crotta</span> <span class="pre">Cliach,</span> <span class="pre">now</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Galty</span> <span class="pre">mountains</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">south</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">Tipperary,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> These were their names : Futh <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Wrongly</span> <span class="pre">printed</span> <span class="pre">*Tuth*</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Rev.</span> <span class="pre">Celt,</span> <span class="pre">v.,</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">199.]</span></code> and Ruth and Regna of Moy Fea, and Temle, and Olpe, and Rogein. There scurvy came upon him, and therefrom he became a scald, whence he used to be called Demne the Bald. At that time there was a reaver in Leinster, Fiacail, the son of Codna. Then in Feeguile <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;In</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">parish</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Cloonsast,</span> <span class="pre">north</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Portarlington,</span> <span class="pre">King's</span> <span class="pre">County,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> Fiacail came upon the <em>cairds</em> and killed them all save Demne alone.

And then they take him with them from the south to the same place.</p></li>
<li><p>One day he went out alone until he reached Moy Liffey, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span> <span class="pre">The</span> <span class="pre">plain</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Liflfey,</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">very</span> <span class="pre">level</span> <span class="pre">plain</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">Kildare,*'</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> and a certain stronghold there ; and he saw the youths hurling upon the green of the stronghold there. He went to contend in running or in hurling with them. He came again the next day, and they put one-fourth of their number against him. Again they come with one-third of their number against him. However, at last they all go against him, and he won his game from them all.</p></li>
<li><p>“What is thy name?” they said. “Demne,” said he. The youths tell that to the man of the stronghold. ” Then kill him, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Read</span> <span class="pre">*marbid-si</span> <span class="pre">de</span> <span class="pre">é*.]</span></code> if ye know how to do it — if ye are able to do it,” said he. ” We should not be able to do aught to him,” said they. ” Did he tell you his name ? ” says he. ” He said,” say they, ” that his name was Demne.” ” What does he look like ? ” said he. ” A shapely fair (<em>finn</em>) youth,” said they. ” Then Demne shall be named Finn (the Fair),” said he. Whence the youths used to call him Finn.</p></li>
<li><p>He came to them on the next day, and went to them at their game. All together they throw their hurlets at him. He turns among them, and throws seven of them to the ground. He went from them into the forest of Slieve Bloom.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, at the end of a week, he came back to the same place. The youths were swimming in a lake that was close by. The youths challenge him to come and try to drown them. Thereupon he jumps into the lake to them, and drowns nine of them in the lake. And after that he goes to Slieve Bloom. ” Who drowned the youths ? ” everybody asks. ” Finn,” say they. So that henceforth [the name] Finn clave to him.</p></li>
<li><p>Once he went forth across Slieve Bloom, and the two women-warriors together with him, when a fleet herd of wild deer is seen [by them] on the ridge of the mountain. ” Alas ! ” say the two old women, ” that we cannot get hold of one of those !” <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Read</span> <span class="pre">ni</span> <span class="pre">tic</span> <span class="pre">din</span> <span class="pre">astud,</span> <span class="pre">&amp;c.]</span></code> “<em>I</em> can,” [says Finn], and he dashes upon them, and lays hold of two bucks among them, and brings them with him to their hunting-booth. After that he would hunt for them constantly. ” Go from us now, lad,” said the women-warriors to him, ” for the sons of Morna are watching to kill thee.”</p></li>
<li><p>Alone he went from them until he reached Lough Leane, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">great</span> <span class="pre">Lake</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Killarney.]</span></code> above Luachair <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[i.e.</span> <span class="pre">Luchair</span> <span class="pre">Dedad,</span> <span class="pre">*&lt;a</span> <span class="pre">district</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Kerry,</span> <span class="pre">containing</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">two</span> <span class="pre">Pap</span> <span class="pre">mountains,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code>,  and there he took military service with the king of Bantry. At that place he did not make himself known. However, there was not at that time a hunter his equal. Thus said the king to him : — ” If Cumall had left a son,” says he, ” one would think thou wast he. However, we have not heard of his leaving a son, except Tulcha mac Cumaill, and he is in military service with the king of Scotland.”</p></li>
<li><p>He afterwards bids farewell to the king, and goes from them to Carbrige, which at this day is [called] Kerry, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">territory</span> <span class="pre">so</span> <span class="pre">called</span> <span class="pre">extended</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">ancient</span> <span class="pre">times</span> <span class="pre">only</span> <span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">Tralee</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Shannon,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> and takes military service with the king of that land. Then, on a certain day, the king came to play <em>fidchell</em>. He was prompted by Finn, and won seven games one after another. ” Who art thou ? ” says the king. ” The son of a peasant of the Luaigni of Tara, says he. “No,” says the king, “but thou art the son whom Muirne bore to Cumall, and be here no longer, lest thou be slain [while] under my protection.”</p></li>
<li><p>Then he went forth to Cullen <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;In</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Tipperary,</span> <span class="pre">near</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">borders</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Limerick,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">O'D.]</span></code> of the Ui Cuanach <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Coonagh</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">now</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">barony,</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">Limerick.]</span></code>, to the house of Lochán, a chief smith, who had a very beautiful daughter, Cruithne by name. She fell in love with the youth. ” I shall give thee my daughter, though I know not who thou art.” Thereupon the girl slept with the youth. ” Make spears for me,” said the youth to the smith. So Lochán made two spears for him. He then bade farewell to Lochán, and went away, ” My son,” says Lochán, ” do not go upon the road on which is the sow called the Beo.” She it was that devastated the midlands of Munster. But what happened to the youth was to go upon the very road on which the sow was. Then the sow charged him ; but he thrust his spear at her, so that it went through her, and left her without life. Then he takes the head of the sow with him to the smith as a bridal gift for his daughter. Hence is Slieve Muck <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*Sliab</span> <span class="pre">Muicce*,</span> <span class="pre">'</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Mountain</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Sow.']</span></code> in Munster.</p></li>
<li><p>After that the youth went onwards into Connaught to seek Crimall, the son of Trénmér. As he was on his way, he heard the wail of a woman. He went towards it, and saw a woman ; and now it was tears of blood, and now a gush of blood, so that her mouth was red. ” Thou art red-mouthed, woman ! says he. ” Good cause have I,” says she, ” for my only son has been slain by a tall, very terrible warrior who came in my way. ” What was thy son’s name ?” says he. ” Glonda was his name,” says she. Hence is the Ford of Glonda and the Causeway of Glonda on Moinmoy,  [ ” Not identified, unless it be Ballyderg,” O’D.]<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">redness</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">mouth</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Ford</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Red</span> <span class="pre">Mouth</span></code>[“A territory lying round Lough Reagh, County Galway,” O’D. ]` has been so called ever since. Then Finn went in pursuit of the warrior, and they fight a combat, and he fell by him. This is how he was : he had the treasure-bag with him, to wit, the treasures of Cumall. He who had fallen there was the Grey one of Luachair, who had dealt the first wound to Cumall in the battle of Cnucha.</p></li>
<li><p>Thereupon he goes into Connaught, and finds Crimall as an old man in a desert wood there, and a number of the old <em>fian</em> together with him ; and it is they who did the hunting for him. Then he shows (?) him the bag, and told him his story from beginning to end ; how he had slain the man of the treasures. Finn bade farewell to Crimall, and went to learn poetry from Finnéces, who was on the Boyne. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[For</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">poets</span> <span class="pre">thought</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">place</span> <span class="pre">where</span> <span class="pre">poetry</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">revealed</span> <span class="pre">always</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">upon</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">brink</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">water</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span> <span class="pre">(*ar</span> <span class="pre">bd</span> <span class="pre">baile</span> <span class="pre">fallsigthe</span> <span class="pre">éicsi</span> <span class="pre">dogrés</span> <span class="pre">lasna</span> <span class="pre">filedu</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">brú</span> <span class="pre">usci*),</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">186</span> <span class="pre">a.]</span></code> He durst not remain in Ireland else, until he took to poetry, for fear of the son of Urgriu, and of the sons of Morna.</p></li>

The youth brought him the salmon after cooking it. ” Hast thou eaten anything of the salmon, my lad ?” says the poet. ” No,” says the youth, ” but I burned my thumb, and put it into my mouth afterwards.” “What is thy name, my lad?” says he. “Demne,” says the youth. ” Finn is thy name, my lad,” says he ; ” and to thee was the salmon given to be eaten, and verily thou art the Finn.” Thereupon the youth eats the salmon. It is that which gave the knowledge to Finn, to wit, whenever he put his thumb into his mouth, and sang through <em>teinm ldida</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;Illumination</span> <span class="pre">(?)</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">song.&quot;]</span></code> then whatever he had been ignorant of would be revealed to him.</p></li>
<li><p>He learnt the three things that constitute a poet, to wit, <em>teinm láida</em> and <em>imbas forosna</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;Knowledge</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">illumines.&quot;]</span></code> and <em>dichetul dichennaib</em>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;Extempore</span> <span class="pre">incantation.&quot;]</span></code> It is then Finn made this lay to prove his poetry <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">translation</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">poem</span> <span class="pre">appeared</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">my</span> <span class="pre">'*</span> <span class="pre">Four</span> <span class="pre">Songs</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Summer</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Winter</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span> <span class="pre">(London,</span> <span class="pre">D.</span> <span class="pre">Nutt,</span> <span class="pre">1903),</span> <span class="pre">whence</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">reprint</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">here.]</span></code> : —</p></li>
<li><p>May-day, season surpassing ! Splendid is colour then. Blackbirds sing a full lay, if there be a slender shaft of day.<br />
The dust-coloured cuckoo calls aloud : Welcome, splendid summer ! The bitterness of bad weather is past, the boughs of the wood are a thicket.<br />
Summer cuts the river down, the swift herd of horses seeks the pool, the long hair of the heather is outspread, the soft white bog-down grows.<br />
Panic startles the heart of the deer, the smooth sea runs apace, — season when ocean sinks asleep, — blossom covers the world.<br />
Bees with puny strength carry a goodly burden, the harvest of blossoms ; up the mountain-side kine take with them mud, the ant makes a rich meal.<br />
The harp of the forest sounds music, the sail gathers — perfect peace. Colour has settled on every height, haze on the lake of full waters.<br />
The corncrake, a strenuous bard, discourses ; the lofty virgin waterfall sings a welcome to the warm pool ; the talk of the rushes is come.<br />
Light swallows dart aloft, loud melody reaches round the hill, the soft rich mast buds, the stuttering quagmire rehearses.<br />
The peat-bog is as the raven’s coat, the loud cuckoo bids welcome, the speckled fish leaps, strong is the bound of the swift warrior.<br />
Man flourishes, the maiden buds in her fair strong pride ; perfect each forest from top to ground, perfect each great stately plain.<br />
Delightful is the season* s splendour, rough winter has gone, white is every fruitful wood, a joyous peace is summer.<br />
A flock of birds settles in the midst of meadows; the green field rustles, wbeiein is a brawling white stream.<br />
A wild longing is on you to race horses, the ranked host is ranged around : a bright shaft has been shot into the land, so that the water-flag is gold beneath it.<br />
A timorous tiny persistent little fellow sings at the top of his voice, the lark sings clear tidings : surpassing May-day of delicate colours !</p></li>
<li><p>However, Finn went to Cethern, the son of Fintan, further to learn poetry with him. At that time there was a very beautiful maiden in Bri Ele, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Now</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Hill</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Croghan,</span> <span class="pre">King's</span> <span class="pre">County.</span> <span class="pre">Cf.</span> <span class="pre">Cruachan</span> <span class="pre">Brig</span> <span class="pre">Ele,</span> <span class="pre">s.</span> <span class="pre">26.]</span></code> that is to say, in the fairy-knoll of Bri Ele, and the name of that maiden was Ele. The men of Ireland were at feud about that maiden. One man after another went to woo her. Every year on Hallowe’en the wooing used to take place ; for the fairy-knolls of Ireland were always open about Hallowe’en ; for on Hallowe’en nothing could ever be hidden in the fairy-knolls. To each man that went to woo her this used to happen : one of his people was slain. This was done to mark the occasion, nor was it ever found out who did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Like everybody else, the poet Cethern went to woo the maiden. However, Finn did not like the poet’s going on that errand. At that time the name of Cumall’s son was Finnéces. As they went to the wooing they formed themselves into three bands. There were nine in each band. As they went towards the fairy-knoll, a man of their people was slain between them ; and it was not known who had slain him. Oircbel the poet was the name of the man that was slain there. Hence is Fert Oircbeil (the Grave of O.) in Clonfad. Thereupon they separated, and Finn went from them and … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[I</span> <span class="pre">do</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">know</span> <span class="pre">what</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">*ni</span> <span class="pre">thaire*]</span></code> However, Finn thought it a grievance and a great disgrace. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">whole</span> <span class="pre">incident</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">mentioned</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">poem</span> <span class="pre">by</span> <span class="pre">Gilla</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Chomded</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">p.</span> <span class="pre">144</span> <span class="pre">b,</span> <span class="pre">44</span> <span class="pre">ff.]</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>He went until he came to the house of the champion Fiacail macjConchinn, at Slievemargpe <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[In</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">S.E.</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Queen's</span> <span class="pre">County.]</span></code> It is there his dwelling was at that time. To him, then, Finn made his complaint, and told him how the man had been slain among them in the fairy-knoll. Fiacail told him to go and sit down by the two Paps of Anu <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Two</span> <span class="pre">mountains</span> <span class="pre">still</span> <span class="pre">so</span> <span class="pre">called</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">barony</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Magunihy,</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">Kerry.]</span></code> behind Luachair. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[i.e.</span> <span class="pre">Luchair</span> <span class="pre">Dedad.]</span></code> So he went and sat down between the two strongholds which are between the two Paps of Anu.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, when Finn was there between them, on Hallowe’en night, he saw the two fairy-knolls opened around him, even the two strongholds, their ramparts having vanished before them. And he saw a great fire in either of the two strongholds ; and he heard a voice from one of them, which said : ” Is your sweet food good ? ” ” Good, indeed ! ” said a voice in the other fairy-knoll. ” A question. Shall anything be taken from us to you ? ” ” If that be given to us, something will be given to you in return.” While Finn was there he saw a man coming out of the fairy-knoll. A kneading-trough was in his hand with a … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[I</span> <span class="pre">do</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">know</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">meaning</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">*slainsi*.]</span></code> pig upon it, and a cooked calf, and a bunch of wild garlic upon it. That was Hallowe*en. The man came past Finn to reach the other knoll. Finn made a cast with the spear of Fiacail mac Conchinn. He hurled it southward from him towards Slieve-margue. Then said Finn : ” If the spear should reach any one of us, may he escape (?) alive from it ! I think this was a revenge for my comrade.” <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[This</span> <span class="pre">incident</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">referred</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">poem</span> <span class="pre">beginning</span> <span class="pre">*Échta</span> <span class="pre">Lagen</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">Leth</span> <span class="pre">Chuind*,</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">48</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">41</span> <span class="pre">;</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">again</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Gilla</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Chomded*s</span> <span class="pre">poem,</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">145</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">2.]</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>That passes, till forthwith he heard a lament, and a great wail, saying : —</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“On the Barrow, by a sharp-pointed spear,<br />
Aed, Fidga’s son, has fallen :<br />
By the spear of Fiacail, Codna’s son,<br />
Finn has slain him … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[*iar</span> <span class="pre">n-imdai*</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">*ic</span> <span class="pre">feiss*,</span> <span class="pre">LL.</span> <span class="pre">144</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">52.]</span></code> “</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Then Fiacail came to Finn, and was at the two Paps of Anu. Fiacail asked him whom he had slain. (“I know not,” saith Finn, “whether any good has come from the cast which I have thrown.” ” Tis likely, indeed,” said Fiacail, ” that some one has been slain. It seems to me if thou do not do it to-night, thou wilt not do it to the end of another year.” However, Finn said that he had sent a cast, and that it seemed likely to him that it had reached some one. And he heard a great wailing in the fairy-knoll, saying : —</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Venom is this spear,<br />
And venomous he whose it is,<br />
Venomous whoever threw it,<br />
Venom for him whom it laid low.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Outside the fairy-knoll of Cruachan Brig Ele Finn seized a woman in pledge for his spear. The woman promised to send out the spear if he released her. Finn let the woman from him into the knoll. Then, as she went into the knoll the woman said : —</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Venom the spear,<br />
And venom the hand that threw it !<br />
If it is not cast out of the knoll,<br />
A murrain will seize Ihe land.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thereupon the spear is thrown out, and Finn takes it with him to where Fiacail was. ” Well,” said Fiacail, ” keep the spear with which thou hast done the famous deed.” Then Fiacail said the occasion was fortunate, since the man had been slain who had killed Finn’s comrade. ” He whom thou hast slain here,” said he, ” ‘tis he who used to kill every man that came to woo the maiden, because it is he who loved the maiden.”</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Thereupon Finn and Fiacail went onward. Now, Fiacail had a tryst with the <em>fian</em> at Inver Colptha. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">estuary</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Boyne.</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code> Then he said to Finn that they should go home … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[I</span> <span class="pre">cannot</span> <span class="pre">translate</span> <span class="pre">*gid</span> <span class="pre">daimh*.]</span></code> since their business was finished. Said Finn : ” Let me go with thee,” says he. ” I do not wish thee to go with me,” says Fiacail, ” lest thy strength should fail thee.” ” I shall find out,” says Finn. Then they went forth. Twelve balls of lead were round the neck of Fiacail to hem his vigour, such was his swiftness. He would throw one ball after another from him, and Finn took them with him, and (yet) Fiacail’s running was no swifter than Finn’s.</p></li>
<li><p>They reach Inver Colptha. Then Finn brought all the twelve balls of lead to him, and he was pleased. That night they slept there. Then they make Finn keep watch that night, and he was told to wake the warrior if he heard any [cry of] outrage. Now, one hour of the night, as Finn was watching, he heard a cry from the north, and did not wake the warrior. He went alone in the direction of the cry to Slieve Slanga. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Now</span> <span class="pre">Slieve</span> <span class="pre">Donard,</span> <span class="pre">County</span> <span class="pre">Down.]</span></code> While Finn was there, among the men of Ulster, at the hour of midnight, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[This</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">take</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">be</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">meaning</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">*tráth</span> <span class="pre">nóna</span> <span class="pre">do</span> <span class="pre">aidchi*.]</span></code> he overtook three women before him, at a green mound, with horns (?) of fairy-women. As they were wailing on that mound, they would all put their hands on the mound. Then the women flee into the fairy-mound before Finn. Finn caught one of the women as she was going into the fairy-knoll of Slanga, and snatched her brooch out of her cloak. The woman went after him, and besought Finn to give her back the brooch of her cloak, and said it was not fit for her to go into the fairy-knoll with a blemish, and she promises a reward … <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[As</span> <span class="pre">we</span> <span class="pre">learn</span> <span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">Gilla</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Chomded's</span> <span class="pre">poem</span> <span class="pre">(LL.</span> <span class="pre">145</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">8),</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">fairy</span> <span class="pre">presented</span> <span class="pre">Finn</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">vessel</span> <span class="pre">full</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">gold</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">silver,</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">he</span> <span class="pre">divided</span> <span class="pre">among</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">*fian*.]</span></code></p></li>
